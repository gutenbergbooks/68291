<p>Growing out of my former volume, <em>Writing the Short-Story</em>,
appeared the use for a new book that should contain
a large number of short-stories arranged and annotated
in form suitable for school or private study. Accordingly,
the unique marginal arrangement for notes,
which was first used in the study of Maupassant’s “The
Necklace,” in the earlier work, was also adopted in this,
with the addition of exhaustive critical introductions and
comments. Further study, whether by classes or by individuals,
has been facilitated by the reading references
upon the authors represented, and&mdash;arranged under
each of the eight type-groups&mdash;the explicit lists of ten
representative short-stories available for reading and
analysis.</p>

<p>Five points were had in mind as a basis for the selection
of the stories included in this collection: First, the
real merit of the story, as illustrating the short-story
structurally perfect, or as nearly perfect as could be
found in combination with the other points desired;
second, the typical qualities of the story, as standing for
the class it was to represent; third, its intrinsic literary
interest for the general reader; fourth, its representative
quality as illustrating the author’s tone and style; fifth,
its suitability for class and private study and analysis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span></p>

<p>Other stories are equally brilliant and equally representative,
but some are too long to fit into such a selection;
others are not available because of publishers’ rules;
still others are morally unsuitable for the uses of mixed
classes of young people; while many capital stories are
the work of authors who have not produced consistently
good work.</p>

<p>The tone of many of the stories included is sad, and
their endings tragic; this is accidental and has not at all
governed the selection from my belief that stories of
tragic quality are necessarily the greatest; though the
tragic phases of life, being the most intense, are the most
likely to offer attractive themes to authors who prefer to
deal with strong and subtle situations. The same is true
of stories dealing with sex problems, but these have been
excluded for obvious reasons. Livelier and more cheerful
stories either were not as representative of the types
I desired to exhibit, or were rejected from other motives.
Those who study these selections with a view to writing
the short-story will do well to bear in mind that fiction
of gloomy tone must be very well written and on themes
of unusual power to atone for their depressing qualities.</p>

<p>For the use of teachers and their pupils, a series of
general questions has been prepared (p. xxxi), besides
questions at the end of each section. Of course these
will be regarded as suggestive rather than exhaustive.</p>

<p>The margins left blank in the stories marked “For
Analysis” may be used for pencil notes, at the option of
the teacher. For further study, strips of writing paper
may be attached to the margins of stories cut from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</span>
magazines and full notes added by the pupil. <em>Writing
the Short-Story</em> will be found an especially practical adjunct
in making the marginal analyses and notes, as that
work gives much space to the general structure of the
short-story and an analysis of its parts. The nomenclature
of <em>Writing the Short-Story</em> has been observed in
this volume, as well as the typographical arrangement,
where practicable&mdash;especially the practise of indicating
short-stories by quotation marks, while printing book-titles
in italics.</p>

<p>I venture to hope that the present work may prove
helpful in disclosing to lovers of the short-story, as well
as to those who wish merely to study its technique, the
means by which authors of international distinction have
secured their effects.</p>

<p>The wide usefulness of <em>Writing the Short-Story</em>, by
the author of this volume, as evidenced by its adoption
for class use in the foremost American universities, colleges,
and schools, and by the many thousands of well-known
writers and younger aspirants who have found
it so helpful in their craft, has encouraged the author to
undertake the present work. Mere collections of short-stories
are not lacking, but no other volume presents an
authoritative international selection, with comprehensive
classifications under leading short-story types, critical
and biographical introductions, illuminating marginal
notes, and opportunities for original study afforded by
margins for the student’s notes, together with questions
and lists of stories for examination and study. Whether
used singly or as a companion volume with <em>Writing the
Short-Story</em>, it is confidently believed that the present
work will prove a notable contribution to the literature
of this most popular and significant literary form.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY
OF THE SHORT-STORY</h2>
</div>


<p>Fiction as an art has made more progress during the
last hundred years than any other literary type. The
first half of the nineteenth century especially developed
a consciousness of subject matter and form in both the
novel and the short-story which has created an epoch as
notable in the history of fiction as was the age of Shakespeare
in the progress of the drama. In Great Britain,
France, Russia, Germany, and America arose fictional
artists of distinguished ability, while in other nations
writers of scarcely less merit soon followed.</p>

<p>The novel demands a special study, so even for its
relation to our theme&mdash;the short-story&mdash;the reader
must be referred to such works as specialize on the
longer form.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A comprehensive treatment of the short-story would
include an inquiry into the origins of all short fictional
forms, for every story that is short is popularly known
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>as a short story. The fullest and best guide for such a
study is Henry Seidel Canby’s historical and critical
treatise, <em>The Short Story in English</em>.</p>

<p>Naturally, an inquiry into origins would prove to be
measurably profitless and certainly dry for the general
student were it not supplemented by the reading of a
great many stories&mdash;preferably in the original&mdash;which
illustrate the steps in short-story development from
earliest times.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A further field for a comprehensive survey would
be a critical comparison of the modern form with its
several ancestral and contributory forms, from original
sources.</p>

<p>A third examen would be devoted to the characteristics
and tendencies of the present-day short-story as presented
in volume form and, particularly, in the modern
magazine.</p>

<p>A fourth, would undertake to study the rhetoric of the
form.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>None of these sorts of study can be exhaustively presented
in this volume, yet all are touched upon so suggestively
and with such full references that the reader
may himself pursue the themes with what fullness he
elects. The special field herein covered will be, I believe,
sufficiently apparent as the reader proceeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span></p>

<p>Let it be understood from the outstart that throughout
this volume the term short-story is used rather loosely
to cover a wide variety of short fiction; yet presently it
will be necessary to show precisely how the modern form
differs from its fictive ancestors, and that distinction will
assume some importance to those who care about recognizing
the several short fictional forms and who enjoy
calling things by their exact names.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The first story-teller was that primitive man who in
his wanderings afield met some strange adventure and
returned to his fellows to narrate it. His narration was
a true story. The first fictionist&mdash;perhaps it was the
same hairy savage&mdash;was he who, having chosen to tell
his adventure, also resolved to add to it some details
wrought of his own fancy. That was fiction, because
while the story was compounded of truth it was worked
out by the aid of imagination, and so was close kin to
the story born entirely of fancy which merely uses true-seeming
things, or veritable contributory facts, to make
the story “real.”</p>

<p>Egyptian tales, recorded on papyrus sheets, date back
six thousand years. Adventure was their theme, while
gods and heroes, beasts and wonders, furnished their incidents.
When love was introduced, obscenities often
followed, so that the ancient tales of pure adventure are
best suited to present-day reading.</p>

<p>What is true of Egypt 4000 B. C. is equally true
of Greece many centuries later. The Homeric stories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
will serve as specimens of adventure narrative; and the
Milesian tales furnish the erotic type.</p>

<p>As for the literary art of these early fictions, we need
only refer to ancient poetry to see how perfect was its
development two thousand and more years ago; therefore&mdash;for
the poets were story-tellers&mdash;we need not
marvel at the majestic diction, poetic ideas, and dramatic
simplicity of such short-stories as the Egyptian
“Tales of the Magicians,”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> fully six thousand years old;
the Homeric legends, told possibly twenty-five hundred
years ago;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> “The Book of Esther,”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> written more than
twenty-one hundred years ago; and the stories by Lucius
Apuleius, in <em>The Golden Ass</em>,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> quite two thousand years
old.</p>

<p>In form these ancient stories were of three types:
the anecdote (often expanded beyond the normal limits
of anecdote); the scenario, or outline of what might well
have been told as a longer story; and the tale, or straightforward
chain of incidents with no real complicating plot.</p>

<p>Story-telling maintained much the same pace until the
early middle ages, when the sway of religious ideas was
felt in every department of life. Superstition had always
vested the forces of nature with more than natural
attributes, so that the wonder tale was normally the companion
of the war or adventure story. But now the
power of the Christian religion was laying hold upon all
minds, and the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conte dévot</i>, or miracle story, recited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
the wonderful doings of the saints in human behalf,
or told how some pious mystic had encountered heavenly
forces, triumphed over demons and monsters of evil, and
performed prodigies of piety.</p>

<p>These tales were loosely hung together, and exhibited
none of the compression and sense of orderly climax
characteristic of the short-story to-day. In style the
early medieval stories fell far below classic models, naturally
enough, for language was feeling the corrupting
influences of that inrush of barbarian peoples which at
length brought Rome to the dust, while culture was conserved
only in out-of-the-way places. In form these
narratives were chiefly the tale, the anecdote, and the
episode, by which I mean a fragmentary part of a longer
tale with which it had little or no organic connection.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conte dévot</i> in England was even more crude, for
Old English was less polished than the speech of France
and its people more heroic than literary.</p>

<p>When we come to the middle of the fourteenth century
we find in two great writers a marked advancement:
Chaucer’s <em>Canterbury Tales</em> and Boccaccio’s <em>Decameron</em>&mdash;the
former superior to the latter in story-telling art&mdash;opened
up rich mines of legend, adventure, humor, and
human interest. All subsequent narrators modeled their
tales after these patterns. Chaucer’s “The Pardoner’s
Tale” has many points in common with the modern
short-story, and so has Boccaccio’s <em>novella</em>, “Rinaldo,”
but these approaches to what we now recognize as the
short-story type were not so much by conscious intention
as by a groping after an ideal which was only dimly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
existent in their minds&mdash;so dimly, indeed, that even
when once attained it seems not to have been pursued.
For the most part the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fabliaux</i><a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of Chaucer and the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">novelle</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> of Boccaccio were rambling, loosely knit, anecdotal,
lacking in the firmly fleshed contours of the
modern short-story. Even the <em>Gesta Romanorum</em>, or
<em>Deeds of the Romans</em>&mdash;181 short legends and stories
first printed about 1473&mdash;show the same ear marks.</p>

<p>About the middle of the sixteenth century appeared
<em>The Arabian Nights</em>, that magic carpet which has carried
us all to the regions of breathless delight. The story
of “Ali Baba and The Forty Thieves,” for one, is as
near an approach to our present-day short-story as was
Irving’s “Rip Van Winkle,” and quite unsurpassed in
all the literature of wonder-tales.</p>

<p>Thus for two thousand years&mdash;yes, for six thousand
years&mdash;the essentials of short story narration were unchanged.
What progress had been made was toward
truth-seeming, clearer characterization, and a finer human
interest, yet so surpassing in these very respects are
some of the ancient stories that they remain models to-day.
Chiefly, then, the short fiction of the eighteenth
century showed progress over that of earlier centuries
in that it was much more consistently produced by a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</span>much greater number of writers&mdash;so far as our records
show.</p>

<p>Separately interesting studies of the eighteenth-century
essay-stories of Addison, Steele, Johnson and others
in the English periodicals, the <em>Spectator</em>, <em>Tatler</em>, <em>Rambler</em>,
<em>Idler</em>, and <em>Guardian</em> might well be made, for these
forms lead us directly to Hawthorne and Irving in
America. Of almost equal value would be a study of
Defoe’s ghost stories (1727) and Voltaire’s development
of the protean French detective-story, in his “Zadig,”
twenty years later.</p>

<p>With the opening of the nineteenth century the marks
of progress are more decided. The first thirty years
brought out a score of the most brilliant story-tellers
imaginable, who differ from Poe and his followers only
in this particular&mdash;they were still perfecting the tale,
the sketch, the expanded anecdote, the episode, and the
scenario, for they had neither for themselves nor for
their literary posterity set up a new standard, as Poe
was to do so very soon.</p>

<p>Of this fecund era were born the German weird
tales of Ernst Amadeus Hoffmann and J. L. Tieck; the
<em>Moral Tales</em> of Maria Edgeworth, and the fictional
episodes of Sir Walter Scott in Scotland; the anecdotal
tales and the novelettes of Prosper Mérimée and Charles
Nodier in France; the tales of Pushkin, the father of
Russian literature; and the tale-short-stories of Washington
Irving and Nathaniel Hawthorne in America. Here
too lies a fascinating field of study, over which to trace
the approach towards that final form, so to call it, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</span>
was both demonstrated and expounded by Poe. It must
suffice here to observe that Irving preferred the easy-flowing
essay-sketch, and the delightful, leisurely tale
(with certain well-marked tendencies toward a compact
plot), rather than the closely organized plot which we
nowadays recognize as the special possession of the
short-story.</p>

<p>In France, from 1830 to 1832, Honoré de Balzac produced
a series of notable short-stories which, while marvels
of narration, tend to be condensed novels in plot,
novelettes in length, or expanded anecdotes. However,
together with the stories of Prosper Mérimée, they furnish
evidence for a tolerably strong claim that the modern
short-story was developed as a fixed form in France
before it was discovered in America&mdash;a claim, however,
which lacks the elements of entire solidity, as a more
critical study would show.</p>

<p>From 1830 on, it would require a catalogue to name,
and volumes to discuss, the array of European and
American writers who have produced fictional narratives
which have more or less closely approached the short-story
form. Until 1835, when Edgar Allan Poe wrote
“Berenice” and “The Assignation,” the approaches to
the present form were sporadic and unsustained and even
unconscious, so far as we may argue from the absence
of any critical standard. After that year both Poe and
others seemed to strive more definitely for the close
plot, the repression of detail, the measurable unity of
action, and the singleness of effect which Poe clearly
defined and expounded in 1842.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</span></p>

<p>Since Poe’s notable pronouncement, the place of the
short-story as a distinctive literary form has been attested
by the rise and growth of a body of criticism, in
the form of newspaper and magazine articles, volumes
given broadly to the consideration of fiction, and books
devoted entirely to the short-story. Many of these contributions
to the literature of criticism are particularly
important because their authors were the first to announce
conclusions regarding the form which have since
been accepted as standard; others have traced with a
nice sense of comparison the origin and development of
those earlier forms of story-telling which marked the
more or less definite stages of progress toward the short-story
type as at present recognized; while still others are
valuable as characterizing effectively the stories of well-known
writers and comparing the progress which each
showed as the short-story moved on toward its present
high place.</p>

<p>Some detailed mention of these writings, among other
critical and historical productions, may be of value
here, without at all attempting a bibliography, but merely
naming chronologically the work of those critics who
have developed one or more phases of the subject with
particular effectiveness.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Interesting and informing as all such historical and
comparative research work certainly is, it must prove
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</span>to be of greater value to the student than to the fiction
writer. True, the latter may profit by a profound knowledge
of critical distinctions, but he is more likely, for a
time at least, to find his freedom embarrassed by attempting
to adhere too closely to form, whereas in fiction a
chief virtue is that spontaneity which expresses <em>itself</em>.</p>

<p>But there would seem to be some safe middle-ground
between a flouting of all canons of art, arising from an
utter ignorance and contempt of the history of any
artistic form, and a timid and tied-up unwillingness to
do anything in fiction without first inquiring, “Am I
obeying the laws as set forth by the critics?” The
short-story writer should be no less unhampered because
he has learned the origin and traced the growth of the
ancient fiction-forms and learned to say of his own work,
or that of others, “Here is a fictional sketch, here a tale,
and here a short-story”&mdash;if, indeed, he does not recognize
in it a delightful hybrid.</p>

<p>By far the most important contribution to the subject
of short-story criticism was made by Edgar Allan Poe,
when in May, 1842, he published in <em>Graham’s Magazine</em>
a review of Hawthorne’s <em>Tales</em>, in which he announced
his theory of the short-story&mdash;a theory which is regarded
to-day as the soundest of any yet laid down.</p>

<p>In 1876, Friedrich Spielhagen pointed out in his
<em>Novelle oder Roman</em> the essential distinction between the
novel and the short-story.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</span></p>
<p>In 1884, Professor Brander Matthews published in the
<em>Saturday Review</em>, London, and in 1885 published in
<em>Lippincott’s Magazine</em>, “The Philosophy of the Short-story,”
in which, independently of Spielhagen, he announced
the essential distinction between the novel and
the short-story, and pointed out its peculiarly individual
characteristics. In a later book-edition, he added greatly
to the original essay by a series of quotations from other
critics and essayists, and many original comparisons between
the writings of master short-story tellers.</p>

<p>In March 11, 1892, T. W. Higginson contributed to
<em>The Independent</em> an article on “The Local Short-Story,”
which was the first known discussion of that important
type.</p>

<p>In 1895, Sherwin Cody published anonymously in London
the first technical treatise on the rhetoric of the
short-story, “The Art of Story Writing.”</p>

<p>In 1896, Professor E. H. Lewis instituted in Chicago
University the first course of instruction in the art of
story-writing.</p>

<p>In 1898, Charles Raymond Barrett published the first
large work on <em>Short Story Writing</em>, with a complete
analysis of Hawthorne’s “The Ambitious Guest,” and
many important suggestions for writers.</p>

<p>In the same year Charity Dye first applied pedagogical
principles to the study of the short story, in <em>The Story-Teller’s
Art</em>.</p>

<p>In 1902, Professor Lewis W. Smith published a brochure,
<em>The Writing of the Short Story</em>, in which psychological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</span>
principles were for the first time applied to the
study and the writing of the short-story.</p>

<p>In 1902, Professor H. S. Canby issued <em>The Short Story</em>,
in which the theory of impressionism was for the first
time developed. In 1903, this essay was included in <em>The
Book of the Short Story</em>, Alexander Jessup collaborating,
together with specimens of stories from the earliest times
and lists of tales and short-stories arranged by periods.</p>

<p>In 1904, Professor Charles S. Baldwin developed a
criticism of <em>American Short Stories</em> which has been
largely followed by later writers.</p>

<p>In 1909, Professor H. S. Canby produced <em>The Short
Story in English</em>, the first voluminous historical and critical
study of the origins, forms, and content of the short-story.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have dwelt upon the history of the short-story thus
in outline because we often meet the inquiry&mdash;sometimes
put ignorantly, sometimes skeptically&mdash;What is a short-story?
Is it anything more than a story that is short?</p>

<p>The passion for naming and classifying all classes of
literature may easily run to extreme, and yet there are
some very great values to be secured by both the reader
and the writer in arriving at some understanding of what
literary terms mean. To establish distinctions among
short fictive forms is by no means to assert that types
which differ from the technical short-story are therefore
of a lower order of merit. Many specimens of cognate
forms possess an interest which surpasses that of short-stories
typically perfect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</span></p>

<p>Ever since Poe differentiated the short-story from the
mere short narrative we have come to a clearer apprehension
of what this form really means. I suppose that
no one would insist upon the standards of the short-story
as being the criterion of merit for short fiction&mdash;certainly
I should commit no such folly in attempting to
establish an understanding, not to say a definition, of
the form. More than that: some short-stories which
in one or more points come short of <em>technical</em> perfection
doubtless possess a human interest and a charm quite
lacking in others which are technically perfect&mdash;just as
may be the case with pictures.</p>

<p>Some things, however, the little fiction must contain
to come technically within the class of perfect short-stories.
It must be centralized about one predominating
incident&mdash;which may be supported by various minor incidents.
This incident must intimately concern one central
character&mdash;and other supporting characters, it may
be. The story must move with a certain degree of
directness&mdash;that is, there must be a thorough exclusion
of such detail as is needless. This central situation or
episode or incident constitutes, in its working out, the
plot; for the plot must not only have a crisis growing
out of a tie-up or crossroads or complication, but the
very essence of the plot will consist in the resolution or
untying or denouement of the complication.</p>

<p>Naturally, the word plot will suggest to many a high
degree of complexity; but this is by no means necessary
in order to establish the claims of a fictitious narrative
to being a short-story. Indeed, some of the best short-stories<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</span>
are based upon a very slender complication; in
other words, their plots are not complex.</p>

<p>Elsewhere<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> I have defined the short-story, and this
statement may serve to crystallize the foregoing. “A
short-story is a brief, imaginative narrative, unfolding a
single predominating incident and a single chief character;
it contains a plot, the details of which are so compressed,
and the whole treatment so organized, as to
produce a single impression.”</p>

<p>But some of these points need to be amplified.</p>

<p>A short-story is brief not merely from the fact that it
contains comparatively few words, but in that it is so
compressed as to omit non-essential elements. It must
be the narration of a single incident, supported, it may
be, by other incidents, but none of these minor incidents
must rival the central incident in the interest of the
reader. A single character must be preëminent, but a
pair of characters coördinate in importance may enjoy
this single preëminence in the story, yet no minor characters
must come to overshadow the central figure. The
story will be imaginative, not in the sense that it must
be imaginary, or that the facts in the story may not be
real facts, but they must be handled and organized in an
imaginative way, else it would be plain fact and not fiction.
The story must contain a plot; that is to say, it
must exhibit a character or several characters in crisis&mdash;for
in plot the important word is crisis&mdash;and the denouement
is the resolution of this crisis. Finally, the whole
must be so organized as to leave a unified impression
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</span>upon the mind of the reader&mdash;it must concentrate and
not diffuse attention and interest.</p>

<p>All of the same qualities that inhere in the short-story
may also be found in the novelette, except that the novelette
lacks the compression, unity and simplicity of the
short-story and is therefore really a short novel. Both
the novel and the novelette admit of sub-plots, a large
number of minor incidents, and even of digressions,
whereas these are denied to the short-story, which throws
a white light on a single crucial instance of life, some
character in its hour of crisis, some soul at the crossroads
of destiny.</p>

<p>There is a tendency nowadays to give a mere outline
of a story&mdash;so to condense it, so to make it swift, that
the narration amounts to merely an outline without the
flesh and blood of the true short-story. In other words,
there is a tendency to call a scenario of a much longer
story&mdash;for instance the outline of a novelette&mdash;a short-story.
This extreme is as remote from the well-rounded
short-story form as the leisurely novelette, padded out
with infinite attention to detail.</p>

<p>The tale differs from the short-story in that it is
merely a succession of incidents without any real sense
of climax other, for example, than might be given by
the close of a man’s life, the ending of a journey, or the
closing of the day. The tale is a chain; the short-story
is a tree. The links of the chain may be extended indefinitely,
but there comes a time when the tree can grow
no longer and still remain a perfect tree. The tale is
practically without organization and without plot&mdash;there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</span>
is little crisis, and the result of the crisis, if any there be,
would be of no vital importance to the characters, for
no special change in their relations to each other grows
out of the crisis in the tale.</p>

<p>A sketch is a lighter, shorter, and more simple form of
fiction than the short-story. It exhibits character in a
certain stationary situation, but has no plot, nor does it
disclose anything like a crisis from which a resolution or
denouement is demanded. It might almost be called a
picture in still life were it not that the characters are
likely to live and to move.</p>

<p>In these introductory pages I have emphasized and
reëmphasized these distinctions in various ways, because
to me they seem to be important. But after all they are
merely historical and technical. A man may be a charming
fellow and altogether admirable even if his complexion
quarrels with his hair and his hands do not match
his feet in relative size.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The present tendency of the British and American
short-story is a matter of moment because no other literary
form commands the interest of so many writers
and readers. All literature is feeling the hand of commerce,
but the short-story is chiefly threatened. The
magazine is its forum, and the magazine must make
money or suspend. Hence the chief inquiry of the editor
is, What stories will make my magazine sell? And this
is his attitude because his publisher will no longer pay
a salary to an editor whose magazine must be endowed,
having no visible means of support.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</span></p>

<p>These conditions force new standards to be set up.
The story must have literary merit, it must be true to
life, it must deal sincerely with great principles&mdash;up to
the limit of popularity. Beyond that it must not be
literary, truthful, or sincere. Popularity first, then the
rest&mdash;if possible.</p>

<p>All this is a serious indictment of the average magazine,
but it is true. Only a few magazines regard their
fiction as literature and not as merely so much merchandise,
to be cut to suit the length of pages, furnish situations
for pictures, and create subscriptions by readers.
Yet somehow this very commercialized standard is working
much good in spite of itself. It is demanding the
best workmanship, and is paying bright men and women
to abandon other pursuits in order to master a good
story-telling method. It is directing the attention of our
ablest literators to a teeming life all about them when
otherwise they might lose themselves in abstractions “up
in the air.” It is, for business reasons, insisting upon
that very compression to which Maupassant attained in
the pursuit of art. It is building up a standard of precise
English which has already advanced beyond the best
work of seventy years ago&mdash;though it has lost much of
its elegance and dignity.</p>

<p>In a word, the commercialized short-story is a mirror
of the times&mdash;it compasses movement, often at the expense
of fineness, crowds incidents so rapidly that the
skeleton has no space in which to wear its flesh, and
prints stories mediocre and worse because better ones
will not be received with sufficient applause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</span></p>

<p>But while the journalized short-story adopts the hasty
standards of the newspaper because the public is too busy
to be critical, in some other respects it mirrors the times
more happily. The lessons of seriousness it utters with
the lips of fun. Its favorite implement is a rake, but it
does uncover evils that ought not to remain hidden.
Finally, it concerns itself with human things, and tosses
speculations aside; it carefully records our myriad-form
local life as the novel cannot; and it has wonderfully
developed in all classes the sense of what is a good story,
and that is a question more fundamental to all literature
than some critics might admit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here then is a new-old form abundantly worth study,
for its understanding, its appreciation, and its practise.
If there is on one side a danger that form may become
too prominent and spirit too little, there are balancing
forces to hold things to a level. The problems, projects
and sports of the day are, after all, the life of the day,
and as such they furnish rightful themes. Really, signs
are not wanting that point to the truth of this optimistic
assertion: The mass of the people will eventually do
the right, and they will at length bring out of the commercialized
short-story a vital literary form too human
to be dull and too artistic to be bad.</p>

<h3>STORIES OF ACTION AND ADVENTURE</h3>


<p>Few words are needed to set forth the meaning of this
caption, for the designation is sufficiently explicit. One
point, however, it will be well to emphasize: In fiction
all action worthy of the name is the outward manifestation
of an inward condition. There is a sense, therefore,
in which all stories that are not mere pictures of internal
states are stories of action; just as it may be said that
all stories are stories of thought, feeling, and resolve.
The point of distinction lies here: in which direction
does the story tend?</p>

<p>In one class, outward action is seen to work profoundly
upon the inward life, and the story shows us the workings
of this influence in its final effect upon the inward
man and his character. In another, an inward state is
the basis, the premise, the initial force, in the story, and
from that beginning the story goes on to show by a series
of outward movements just how this great inward force
operates in and upon conduct. In a third class, outward
and inward action balance.</p>

<p>Now when the outward or visible action, prominently
displaying physical movement, becomes paramount,
whether shown as cause or as effect, we have the action-story,
and sometimes the adventure-story. And in proportion
as the interest of the reader centers in what the
characters <em>do</em> instead of in what they <em>are</em>, the story departs
from the subtler forms, such as the character-study
and the psychological-study, and action or adventure becomes
the type. Reverse these conditions, and another
sort is the result.</p>

<p>Naturally, many variations are possible with these two
chief ingredients ready for use. One story may begin
with soul action, then proceed to show us bodily action
with great vividness, and end by taking us back into the
man’s inner life. Another may progress on contrary
lines; and so on, in wide variety. The final test as to
what is the predominating type lies in the appeal to the
interest of the reader: is it based chiefly on what the
characters are or on what they do? Is it the why, or the
how, the motive or the happening, that is most absorbing?
The best stories, even the best action and adventure yarns,
are likely to show a fair proportion of both.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3>MÉRIMÉE AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>
</div>


<p>Prosper Mérimée was born in Paris, September 28,
1803. His father, a Norman, was a professor in the
<em>École des Beaux-Arts</em>, and his mother, Anne Moreau,
who had English blood in her veins, was also an artist.
Prosper attended the <em>Collège Henri IV</em>, and in the home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
of his parents met the <em>literati</em> of the day. He undertook
the study of law, but soon abandoned it, and spent some
years in observing life while journeying abroad. He
made much of ancient and modern languages, becoming
especially proficient in Spanish. Upon his return to
Paris he served in public office, and held the post of
Inspector General of Public Monuments until declining
health compelled him to retire. He was elected to several
learned societies and became a commander of the
Legion of Honor, and, in 1844, a member of the French
Academy. Nine years later he was made a Senator of
France, an honor he owed to the friendship of the
Empress Eugénie. He died at Cannes on the 23rd of
September, 1870, at the age of sixty-seven.</p>

<p>Prosper Mérimée was a successful poet, translator,
novelist, and short-story writer. His translations of the
Russian novelists have been pronounced excellent.
“Colomba” is a romantic novelette of singular power
and charm. His most famous short-stories are “The
Taking of the Redoubt,” “Tamango,” “Federigo,”
“The Etruscan Vase,” “The Vision of Charles XI,”
“The Venus of Ille,” “The Pearl of Toledo,” “Carmen”
(on which Bizet’s opera is founded), “Arsène Guillot,”
and “Mateo Falcone”; which follows, in a translation
by the editor of this volume. It was first published in
the <em>Revue de Paris</em>, May, 1829.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among French masters of the short-story, Mérimée
easily holds place in the first rank. Both personality and
genius are his, and both well repay careful study. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
was an alert student of history, to whom its anecdotal
side made strongest appeal. The detached, impersonal,
unprejudiced attitude of the historian is seen in his short-stories,
for he tells his narrative impartially, with a sort
of take-it-or-leave-it air, allowing the story to make its
own appeal without any special pleading on his part.
His story-telling manner is, therefore, one of ironical
coldness. He delighted to tell his tales in the matter-of-fact
manner of the casual traveller who has picked up a
good yarn and passes it on just as it was told him. And
this literary attitude was a reflex of his personality. To
him, to love deeply was to endure pain, to follow impulse
was to court trouble, to cherish enthusiasms was to delude
the mind, so he schooled himself to appear impassive.
Yet now and then in his lucid and clear-cut stories, as in
his urbane life, a certain sweetness is revealed which
speaks alluringly of the tender spirit within.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p1">All my life I have sought to free myself from prejudices, to
be a citizen of the world before being a Frenchman, but now all
these garments of philosophy are nothing to me. To-day I bleed
for the wounds of the foolish French, I mourn for their humiliations,
and, however ungrateful and absurd they may be, I love
them still.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prosper Mérimée</span>, <em>letter to Madame de Beaulaincourt</em>
(Marquise de Castellane), written, ten days before his
death, on hearing from his friend Thiers that the disaster of
Sedan was irreparable and that the Empire was a thing of the
past.</p>


<p class="p1">A gallant man and a gentleman, he has had the reward he would
have wished. He has been discreetly and intimately enjoyed by
delicate tastes.... It was his rare talent to give us those limpid,
rapid, full tales, that one reads in an hour, re-reads in a day,
which fill the memory and occupy the thoughts forever.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Émile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>

the World’s Best Literature</em>.</p>


<p class="p1"><em>Colomba</em>, <em>Mateo Falcone</em>, <em>La Double Méprise</em>, <em>La Vénus d’Ille</em>,
<em>L’Enlèvement de la Redoute</em>, <em>Lokis</em>, have equals, but no superiors,
either in French prose fiction or in French prose. Grasp of
human character, reserved but masterly description of scenery,
delicate analysis of motive, ability to represent the supernatural,
pathos, grandeur, simple narrative excellence, appear turn by
turn in these wonderful pieces, as they appear hardly anywhere
else.&mdash;<span class="smcap">George Saintsbury</span>, <em>A Short History of French Literature</em>.</p>


<p class="p1">While inferior to Stendhal as a psychologist, notwithstanding
the keenness of his analysis, he excels him in opening out and
developing action, and in composing a work whose parts hang
well together. In addition he possesses a “literary” style,&mdash;not
the style of an algebraist, but that of an exact, self-sustained
writer. He attains the perfection of form in his particular line.
Nearly all his stories are masterpieces of that rather dry and
hard, though forceful, nervous, and pressing style, which constitutes
him one of the most original and most characteristic novelists
of the century.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Georges Pellissier</span>, <em>The Literary Movement
in France</em>.</p>


<p class="p1">I do not scruple to apply the word <em>great</em> to Mérimée, a word
which is not to be used lightly, but of which he is thoroughly
deserving. His style is the purest and clearest of our century;
no better model could possibly be found for our present generation.
His prose, to my mind, together with that of Musset,
Fromentin, and Renan, is the most beautiful modern prose which
has ever been written in the French language. Like the great
classics of the 17th century, he never wrote a passage merely to
please the eye or the ear; his sole aim was to express thought,
and the colour of his language, which is so pre-eminently true to
nature, is of a rare sobriety; he never studies effect, and, nevertheless,
invariably attains it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edouard Grenier</span>, <em>Literary Reminiscences</em>.</p>

and turns northwest toward the

seen to rise quite rapidly, and after
three hours’ walk by tortuous paths,
blocked by large masses of rocks, and
sometimes cut by ravines, the traveler
finds himself on the edge of a very
extensive <em>maquis</em>. This bush is the
home of the Corsican shepherds, and
of whomsoever has come into conflict
with the law. It is well known
that the Corsican laborer, to spare
himself the trouble of fertilizing his
lands, sets fire to a certain stretch of
forest; so much the worse if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>

whatever happens, he is sure to have
a good harvest by sowing upon this
ground, enriched by the ashes of the
very trees which it grows. When the
corn is plucked, he leaves the straw,
because it is too much trouble to
gather it. The roots, which have remained
in the ground without being
harmed, sprout in the following
spring into very thick shoots, which
in a few years attain a height of
seven or eight feet. This sort of underwood
it is that they call <em>maquis</em>.
It is composed of different kinds of
trees and shrubs, all mixed and tangled,
just as they were planted by
God. Only with the hatchet in hand
can a man open a passage, and there
are <em>maquis</em> so dense and so tufted
that even the wild sheep can not

His skill in shooting was considered
extraordinary, even in his
country, where there were so many
good shots. <span class="sidenote">Illustrative anecdotes.</span>For example, Mateo
would never fire on a sheep with
buckshot, but at a hundred and
twenty paces he would bring it down
with a bullet in its head, or in the
shoulder, as he chose. At night he
could use his gun as easily as by day,
and they told me the following example
of his skill, which will perhaps
seem incredible to those who have
not traveled in Corsica. At eighty
paces, a lighted candle was placed behind
a transparent piece of paper as
large as a plate. He took aim, then
the candle was extinguished, and after
a moment in the most complete
darkness, he shot and pierced the
transparency three times out of four.</p>

everyone in the district of Porto-Vecchio.
But they tell of him that
when at Corte, where he had gotten
a wife, he had very vigorously freed
himself of a rival who was reputed
to be as redoubtable in war as in

<p>5. The affair having been hushed
up, Mateo married. His wife Giuseppa
had first presented him with
three daughters (which enraged
him), but finally a son came, <span class="sidenote">Central character introduced
unobtrusively.</span>whom
he named Fortunato: he was the
hope of the family, the inheritor of
the name. <span class="sidenote">Vendetta and clan spirit.</span>The girls were well married;
their father could reckon, in
case of need, upon the poniards and

was only ten years old, but he was
already showing signs of a promising
disposition.</p>

<p>6. On a certain day in autumn, Mateo
and his wife set out early to
visit one of their flocks in a clearing
of <em>maquis</em>. Little Fortunato wished
to accompany them, but the clearing
was too far away; besides, someone
must stay to guard the house; so the
father refused: we shall soon see if
he had no occasion to repent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Setting in contrast with
crisis about to appear.</div>

<p>7. He had been gone for some
hours, and little Fortunato was tranquilly
stretched out in the sunshine,
looking at the blue mountains, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
thinking that on the next Sunday he
would be going to town to dine with
his uncle the corporal,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> <span class="sidenote">All the footnotes are by
Mérimée.</span>
 when he was
suddenly interrupted in his meditations
by the firing of a gun. He got
up and turned toward that side of
the plain from which the sound had <span class="sidenote">Action now supersedes setting.</span>
come. Other gunshots followed,
fired at irregular intervals, and each
time they came nearer and nearer. <span class="sidenote">Note force of “irregular.”</span>
At last on the path which led from
the plain to Mateo’s house, appeared
a man wearing a cap pointed like
those worn by the mountaineers. <span class="sidenote">Dramatic introduction of a
leading character, and
preparation for first crisis.</span>He
was bearded and covered with rags,
and dragged himself along with difficulty
by leaning on his gun. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Second Plot Incident.</span></span>He
had just received a gunshot wound
in the thigh.</p>

<p>8. This man was a bandit,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> who
having set out at night to get some
powder from the town, had fallen on
the way into an ambush of Corsican
soldiers.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> After a vigorous defense
he had succeeded in making his retreat,
hotly pursued and skirmishing
from rock to rock. But he had
gained only a little on the soldiers,
and his wound made it hopeless for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>him to reach the <em>maquis</em> before being
overtaken.</p>

<p>9. He approached Fortunato and
said to him:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crisp dialogue gives feeling
of intensity.</div>

<p>10. “You are the son of Mateo
Falcone?”</p>

<p>11. “Yes.”</p>


<p id="par12">12. “I am Gianetto Sanpiero. I
am pursued by the yellow collars.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Hide me, for I can go no further.”</p>

<p>13. “And what will my father say
if I hide you without his permission?”</p>

<p>14. “He will say that you have
done right.”</p>

<p>15. “How do you know?”</p>

<p>16. “Hide me quickly; they are
coming.”</p>

<p>17. “Wait till my father comes.”</p>

<p>18. “How can I wait! A curse
upon it! They will be here in five
minutes. Come, hide me, or I will
kill you.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the lad’s constant coolness,
and sly calculation.</div>

<p>19. Fortunato answered him with
the utmost coolness:</p>

<p>20. “Your gun is empty, and there
are no more cartridges in your <em>carchera</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>21. “I have my stiletto.”</p>

<p>22. “But could you run as fast as
I can?”</p>

<p>23. He gave a leap, and put himself
out of reach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The right of asylum to kin
is sacred to primitive peoples.</div>

<p>24. “You are no son of Mateo Falcone!
Will you then allow me to be
taken in front of your home?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>25. The child seemed to be touched.<span class="sidenote">Note force of “seemed.”</span></p>

<p>26. “What will you give me if I
hide you?” he asked him, drawing
nearer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crisis particularized.<br />
<span class="smcap">Plot Incident Particularized.</span></div>

<p>27. The fugitive felt in the leather
pouch that hung at his belt, and took
out a five-franc piece, which he had
reserved, no doubt, for powder.
Fortunato smiled at sight of the piece <span class="sidenote">Shows value of the reward.</span>
of money, and seizing hold of it, he
said to Gianetto:</p>


<p>28. “Fear nothing!”<span class="sidenote">Revelation of character.</span>
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Resolution of first crisis.</span></div>


<p>29. He quickly made a large hole
in a haystack which stood near by
the house, Gianetto crouched down
in it, and the child covered him up
in such a way as to leave a little
space for breathing, without making
it possible for any one to suspect that
the hay concealed a man. He acted,
still further, with the cunning of a
tricky savage. <span class="sidenote">Author’s real estimate of
the boy.</span>He went and brought
a cat and her kittens, and set them
on top of the haystack to make believe
that it had not been recently
touched. Then noticing the blood-stains
on the path near the house, he
carefully covered them with dust.
This done, he lay down again in the
sun with the utmost calmness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Third Plot Incident.</span>
See <a href="#par12">¶12</a>.</div>

<p>30. Some minutes later six men in
brown uniforms with yellow collars,
commanded by an adjutant, stood before
Mateo’s door. This adjutant
was a distant relative of Falcone&mdash;for
in Corsica more remote degrees<span class="sidenote">A deputy in command.</span>
of relationship are recognized than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
elsewhere. <span class="sidenote">Note complication by this
relationship.</span>His name was Tidora
Gamba; he was an energetic man,
greatly feared by the banditti, many
of whom he had already hunted
down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crisis recurs.</div>

<p>31. “Good day, little cousin,” he
said, coming up to Fortunato. “How
you have grown! Have you seen a
man passing just now?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cunning in character further
revealed.</div>

<p>32. “Oh, I am not so tall as you,
Cousin,” the child replied with a foolish
look.</p>

<p>33. “That time’s coming. But have
you not seen a man pass by?&mdash;Tell
me.”</p>

<p>34. “If I have seen a man pass
by?”</p>

<p>35. “Yes, a man with a pointed
cap and a waistcoat embroidered in
red and yellow?”</p>

<p>36. “A man with a pointed cap
and a waistcoat embroidered in red
and yellow?”</p>

<p>37. “Yes; answer quickly, and
don’t repeat my questions.”</p>

<p>38. “This morning Monsieur le
Curé passed our door on his horse
Piero. He asked me how papa was,
and I told him&mdash;”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspense.</div>

<p>39. “Ah, you little rascal, you are
making game of me! Tell me at
once which way Gianetto went, for
it is he that we are after, and I am
certain he took this path.”</p>

<p>40. “How do you know that?”</p>

<p>41. “How do I know that? I
know you have seen him.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Child’s crafty nature increasingly
disclosed.</div>

<p>42. “Does one see passers-by
when one is asleep?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>43. “You were not asleep, you little
demon; the gunshots would have
waked you.”</p>

<p>44. “You think, then, Cousin, that
your guns make a great noise? My
father’s rifle makes much more.”</p>

<p>45. “May the devil confound you,
you young scamp! I am sure enough
that you have seen Gianetto. Perhaps
you have even hidden him.
Here, comrades, go into this house,
and see if our man is not there.
He could walk only on one foot, and
he has too much good sense, the rascal,
to have tried to reach the <em>maquis</em>
limping. Besides, the marks of
blood stop here.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sly appeal to the fear inspired
by Mateo’s reputation.</div>

<p>46. “Whatever will papa say!”
asked Fortunato, with a chuckle;
“what will he say when he finds out
that his house has been entered while
he was away!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note use of suspense
throughout. The story is
one long crisis.</div>

<p>47. “Good-for-nothing!” cried the
adjutant Gamba, taking him by the
ear, “do you know that I am able to
make you change your tune? Perhaps
when I have given you a score
or more thwacks with the flat of a
sword, you will speak at last!”</p>

<p>48. But Fortunato still laughed derisively.</p>

<p id="p49">49. “My father is Mateo Falcone!”
he said with energy.</p>

<p>50. “Do you know, you little rogue,
that I can carry you off to Corte, or
to Bastia? I’ll make you sleep in a
dungeon, on a pallet of straw, your
feet in irons, and I’ll have you guillotined,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
if you don’t tell me where
Gianetto Sanpiero is.”</p>

<p>51. The child burst out laughing at
this foolish threat. He only repeated:</p>

<p>52. “My father is Mateo Falcone!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compare with <a href="#p4">¶4</a> and <a href="#p49">¶49</a>.</div>

<p>53. “Adjutant,” whispered one of
the <em>voltigeurs</em>, “we’d better not embroil
ourselves with Mateo.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Setting is thus interwoven
with the story, though
slightly.</div>



<p>54. Gamba seemed evidently embarrassed.
He talked in a low voice
with his soldiers, who had already
been through the house. It was not
a lengthy operation, for the cabin of
a Corsican consists of only a single
square room. The furniture comprises
a table, some benches, a few
boxes, and utensils for hunting and
housekeeping. Meanwhile, little Fortunato
caressed his cat, <span class="sidenote">Character revelation.</span>and seemed
maliciously to enjoy the embarrassment
of the <em>voltigeurs</em> and his cousin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspense augmented.</div>

<p>55. One soldier came up to the haystack.
He looked at the cat and carelessly
gave a dig at the hay with his
bayonet, shrugging his shoulders as
if he thought the precaution were
ridiculous. Nothing stirred, and the
face of the child did not betray the
least emotion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More crafty coolness.</div>

<p>56. The adjutant and his troop
were in despair; they were looking
seriously toward the edge of the
plain, as though disposed to return
the way they had come; <span class="sidenote">The turn in the plot.</span>when their
chief&mdash;convinced that threats would
produce no effect upon the son of
Falcone&mdash;thought he would make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Foundation for main
crisis.</span></span>
one last effort by trying the power of
cajoleries and presents.</p>

<p>57. “Little Cousin,” he said, “you
seem to be a wide-awake young fellow
enough. You will get on! But
you play a mean trick with me; and,
if I did not fear to give pain to my
cousin Mateo, devil take me, I’d carry
you off with me!”</p>

<p>58. “Bah!”</p>

<p>59. “But, when my cousin returns
I shall relate to him the whole affair,
and for your having gone to the
trouble to tell me a lie, he will give
you the whip till he draws blood.”</p>

<p>60. “Do you know that?”</p>

<p>61. “You’ll find out! But, see here&mdash;be
a good lad, and I’ll give you
something.”</p>

<p>62. “I, my Cousin, will give you
some advice&mdash;it is, that if you delay
any more Gianetto will reach the <em>maquis</em>,
then it will take a cleverer fellow
to go and hunt for him.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Main crisis augmented.</div>



<p>63. The adjutant drew from his
pocket a silver watch worth quite ten
crowns; and seeing how the little
Fortunato’s eyes sparkled when he<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Plot Incident Particularized.</span></span>
looked at it, he said, as he held the
watch suspended at the end of its
steel chain:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character appeal.</div>

<p>64. “You rogue! you would like
very well to have such a watch as
this hung round your neck, and to go
and promenade the streets of Porto-Vecchio,
proud as a peacock; people
would ask you, ‘What time is it?’
and you would reply, ‘Look at my
watch!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>65. “When I am grown up, my
uncle the corporal will give me a
watch.”</p>

<p>66. “Yes; but your uncle’s son has
one already&mdash;not such a fine one as
this, it is true&mdash;of course, he is
younger than you.”</p>

<p id="par67">67. The child sighed.</p>

<p>68. “Well, would you like this
watch, little Cousin?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspense.</div>

<p>69. Fortunato, ogling the watch out
of the corner of his eyes, looked just
as a cat does when they suddenly offer
it a chicken. Because it is afraid
a joke is being played on it, it dares
not pounce upon its prey, and from
time to time it turns away its eyes so
as not to succumb to the temptation;<span class="sidenote">Illustration.</span>
but it constantly licks its chops, as if
to say to its master, “But your joke
is a cruel one!”</p>

<p>70. However, the adjutant Gamba
seemed to be offering the watch in
good faith. Fortunato did not hold
out his hand, but he said to him with
a bitter smile:</p>

<p>71. “Why do you jest with me?”</p>

<p>72. “By Heaven, I am not joking!
Only tell me where Gianetto is and
this watch is yours.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compare with <a href="#par67">¶67</a>.</div>

<p>73. Fortunato allowed an incredulous
sigh to escape him; and, fixing
his black eyes on those of the adjutant,
he sought to find in them the
faith he wished to have in his words.</p>


<div class="sidenote">A typical Latin protest.</div>

<p>74. “May I lose my epaulets,” cried
the adjutant, “if I do not give you
the watch on these terms! My comrades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
are witnesses, and I cannot go
back on my word!”</p>


<p>75. So speaking, he held the watch
nearer and nearer until it almost
touched the pale cheeks of the child,
whose face showed plainly the combat
going on in his heart between
covetousness and his respect for the
laws of hospitality. <span class="sidenote">A key to the plot.</span>His bare breast
heaved violently, and he seemed to be
almost stifling. All the time the
watch dangled and turned, and sometimes
grazed the tip of his nose. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Main Crisis.</span></span>At
length, little by little, his right hand
lifted toward the watch, the ends of
his fingers touched it, and it rested
wholly on his palm, except that the
adjutant still loosely held the end of
the chain. The face was blue, the
case was newly polished&mdash;in the sunshine
it seemed to be all afire. The
temptation was too strong.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Crisis resolved and Downward
Action Begins.
Henceforward we see
the Results of crisis,
leading to the Climax.</span></div>

<p>76. So Fortunato raised his left
hand and with his thumb pointed
over his shoulder to the haystack
against which he was standing. The
adjutant understood him immediately.
He let go the end of the chain; Fortunato
felt himself sole possessor of
the watch. <span class="sidenote">Still sly.</span>He jumped up with the
agility of a deer, and moved ten
paces away from the stack, which the
<em>voltigeurs</em> at once began to overturn.</p>

<p>77. It was not long before they saw
the hay move, and a bleeding man,
poniard in hand, came forth. But
when he tried to rise to his feet, his
stiffening wound would not permit
him to stand. He fell down. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
adjutant threw himself upon him and
snatched away his stiletto. Speedily,
he was securely bound, in spite of his
resistance.</p>

<p>78. Gianetto, laid on the ground
and tied like a bundle of fagots,
turned his head toward Fortunato,
who had drawn nearer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Contributory Incident.</span>
(A contributory
incident might be changed
or even omitted without
vitally changing the
plot.)</div>

<p>79. “Son of&mdash;,” he said to him
with more contempt than anger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tardy attempt to appear sincere. His contempt is all for Fortunato.</div>
<p>80. The boy threw to him the silver-piece
that he had received from
him, feeling conscious that he no
longer merited it; but the outlaw
seemed not to notice this action. He
said to the adjutant in a perfectly
cool voice:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Second Contributory Incident.</span></div>

<p>81. “My dear Gamba, I am not able
to walk; you will be obliged to carry
me to the town.”</p>

<p>82. “You could run as fast as a kid
just now,” retorted his cruel captor.
“But be easy, I am so glad to have
caught you that I could carry you for
a league on my own back without being
tired. All the same, my friend,
we are going to make a litter for you
out of some branches and your cloak,
and at the farm at Crespoli we shall
find some horses.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character revelation.<br />
Let-down in tension.</div>

<p>83. “Good!” said the prisoner.
“You had better also put a little
straw on your litter that I may travel
more easily.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">New and resultant crisis. Fourth Plot Incident.</span></div>


<p>84. While the <em>voltigeurs</em> were occupied,
some making a sort of stretcher
out of chestnut boughs, and others
dressing Gianetto’s wound, Mateo
Falcone and his wife suddenly appeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
in a bend of the path which
led from the <em>maquis</em>. <span class="sidenote">Contrast to tragic spirit of
the story.</span>The wife advanced,
bending laboriously under an
enormous bag of chestnuts, while her
husband came up jauntily, carrying in
his hand only a gun, while another
was slung over his shoulder, <span class="sidenote">Local color.</span>for it is
unworthy of a man to carry any other
burden than his weapons.</p>


<p>85. At sight of the soldiers, Mateo’s
first thought was that they had come
to arrest him. But why that idea?
Had he any quarrel with the law?
No. He bore a good reputation. He
was, as they say, particularly well
thought of; but he was a Corsican, a
mountaineer, and there are but few
Corsican mountaineers who, if they
scrutinize their memories well, cannot
find some pecadillo&mdash;some gunshot,
some dagger thrust, or some similar
bagatelle. <span class="sidenote">“Bagatelle” discloses the
Corsican attitude.</span>Mateo, more than most,
had a clear conscience, for it was
fully ten years since he had pointed
his gun against a man; but all the
same he was prudent, and he put
himself in position to make a good
defense, if need be.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To reload his weapons, as
appears in <a href="#par87">¶87</a>.</div>

<p>86. “Wife,” said he to Giuseppa,
“put down your sack and keep yourself
in readiness.”</p>



<p id="par87">87. She obeyed on the instant. He
gave her the gun that was slung over
his shoulder, and which would likely
cause him inconvenience. <span class="sidenote">Suspense.</span>He cocked
the one he had in his hand and advanced
slowly toward the house,
skirting the trees which bordered the
path, and ready at the least hostile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
demonstration to throw himself behind
the largest trunk, whence he
could fire from cover. His wife
walked close behind him, holding his
spare gun and his cartridge box. <span class="sidenote">Local color.</span>The
duty of a good housewife, in case of
conflict, is to reload her husband’s
weapons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Development of fourth incident.</div>

<p>88. On the other side, the adjutant
was very uneasy at sight of Mateo
advancing thus upon them with measured
steps, his gun forward and his
finger on the trigger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Key.</div>

<p>89. “If it should chance,” thought
he, “that Gianetto is related to Mateo,
or that he is his friend, and he
intends to protect him, the bullets of
his two guns will come to two of us <span class="sidenote">A fight would ensue.</span>
as sure as a letter to the post, and if
he should aim at me, good-bye to our
kinship!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note force of “alone.”</div>

<p>90. In this perplexity, he put on a
courageous front and went forward
alone toward Mateo to tell him of the
matter, while greeting him like an old
acquaintance; but the brief space that
separated him from Mateo seemed to
him terribly long.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note constraint.</div>

<p>91. “Hello! Ah! my old comrade,”
he called out. “How are you, old
fellow? It’s I, Gamba, your cousin.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Resolution of suspense.</div>

<p>92. Mateo, without replying a word,
stopped, and while the other was
speaking he imperceptibly raised the
muzzle of his rifle in such a manner
that it was pointing heavenward by
the time the adjutant came up to him.</p>

<p>93. “Good day, brother,”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> said the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>adjutant, holding out his hand. “It’s
a very long time since I’ve seen
you.”</p>

<p>94. “Good day, brother.”</p>


<div class="sidenote">Diminutive for Giuseppa.</div>
<p>95. “I just came in, while passing,
to say ‘good day’ to you and my
cousin Pepa. We have had a long
journey to-day; but we must not complain
of fatigue, <span class="sidenote">There is something manlike
in most of Mérimée’s female
characters.</span>for we have taken a
famous prize. We have just got
hold of Gianetto Sanpiero.”</p>

<p>96. “God be praised!” exclaimed
Giuseppa. “He stole one of our
milch goats last week.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character contrast.</div>

<p>97. These words rejoiced Gamba.</p>

<p>98. “Poor devil!” said Mateo.
“He was hungry.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">New crisis. <span class="smcap">Preparation
for climax.</span></div>

<p>99. “The fellow defended himself
like a lion,” pursued the adjutant,
slightly mortified. “He killed one
of the men, and, not content with
that, he broke Corporal Chardon’s
arm; but that is not such a great disaster,
for he is nothing but a Frenchman....
Then he hid himself so
cleverly that the devil would not
have been able to find him. Without
my little cousin Fortunato, I
should never have discovered him.”</p>

<p>100. “Fortunato!” cried Mateo.</p>

<p>101. “Fortunato!” repeated Giuseppa.</p>

<p>102. “Yes, Gianetto was hidden
way down in your haystack; but my
little cousin showed me his trick.
So I will speak of him to his uncle
the corporal, that he may send him
a fine present for his trouble. And
his name and yours will be in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
report which I shall send to <em>Monsieur
l’avocat général</em>.”</p>

<p>103. “Malediction!” said Mateo
under his breath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Misunderstanding adds to
complication.</div>
<p>104. They had now rejoined the
detachment. Gianetto was already
laid on the litter and they were ready
to leave. When he saw Mateo in the
company of Gamba, he smiled a
strange smile; then, turning himself
toward the door of the house, he
spat on the threshold as he cried out:</p>



<p>105. “House of a traitor!”</p>

<p>106. No one but a man who had
made up his mind to die would have
dared to utter the word “traitor” as
applying to Falcone. <span class="sidenote">Key to plot. <span class="smcap">Fifth Plot
Incident.</span></span>One good stroke
of the dagger, which would not need
to be repeated, would have immediately
repaid the insult. But Mateo
made no other gesture than that of
putting his hand to his head like a
dazed man.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Third Contributory Incident.</span></div>

<p>107. Fortunato had gone into the
house upon seeing his father come
up. He reappeared shortly with a
jug of milk, which he offered with <span class="sidenote">Is this repentance, fear, hypocrisy,
or an attempt to
placate his father?</span>
downcast eyes to Gianetto. “Keep
away from me!” cried the outlaw in
a voice of thunder.</p>

<p>108. Then turning to one of the
<em>voltigeurs</em>,</p>

<p>109. “Comrade, give me a drink of
water,” he said.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Delineation of mood by
suggestion.</div>

<p>110. The soldier placed the gourd
in his hands, and the bandit drank
the water given him by a man with
whom he had just exchanged gunshots.
He then asked that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
would tie his hands across his breast
instead of having them behind his
back.</p>

<p>111. “I prefer,” he said, “to lie
down at my ease.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Fourth Contributory Incident.</span></div>

<p>112. When they had adjusted them
to his satisfaction, the adjutant gave
the signal to start, said adieu to Mateo&mdash;who
answered never a word&mdash;and
went down at a quick pace toward
the plain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspense.</div>

<p>113. Some ten minutes passed before
Mateo opened his mouth. The
child looked with an uneasy eye first
at his mother, then at his father, who,
leaning on his gun, was gazing at
him with a gaze of concentrated
wrath.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Preparation for Climax.</span>
<span class="smcap">Sixth and Final Plot Incident.</span></div>

<p id="par114">114. “You begin well,” said Mateo
at last, in a voice calm but terrifying
to those who knew the man.</p>

<p>115. “Father!” exclaimed the child
with tears in his eyes, drawing near
as if to fall upon his knees.</p>

<p>116. But Mateo only cried out:</p>

<p>117. “Away from me!”</p>

<p>118. The child stopped and began
to sob, standing motionless a few
steps from his father.</p>

<p>119. Giuseppa came near. She had
just perceived the chain of the watch
dangling about from Fortunato’s
blouse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrast with <a href="#par114">¶114</a>.</div>

<p>120. “Who gave you that watch?”
she asked him severely.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the sly use of
“cousin.”</div>

<p>121. “My cousin the adjutant.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Fifth Contributory Incident.</span></div>

<p>122. Falcone seized the watch, and,
throwing it violently against a stone,
broke it into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>123. “Woman,” he said, “this child&mdash;is
he mine?”</p>

<p>124. Giuseppa’s brown cheeks
flamed brick-red.</p>

<p>125. “What are you saying, Mateo?
Do you know to whom you are
speaking?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Key.</div>

<p>126. “Well, this child is the first of
his race who has committed a treason.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decision, and foundation
for final crisis.</div>

<p>127. Fortunato’s sobs and hiccoughs
redoubled, and Falcone kept his lynx-eyes
always fixed upon him. At
length he struck the ground with the
butt of his gun; <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Full Resultant Crisis.</span></span>then he flung it
across his shoulder and, calling to
Fortunato to follow him, retook the
way to the <em>maquis</em>. The child
obeyed.</p>

<p>128. Giuseppa ran after Mateo, and
seized him by the arm.</p>

<p>129. “He is your son,” she said to
him in a trembling voice, fixing her
black eyes on those of her husband,
as though to read what was passing
through his mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the double meaning.</div>

<p>130. “Let me go,” replied Mateo:
“I am his father.”</p>

<p>131. Giuseppa embraced her son,
and went back crying into the hut.
She threw herself on her knees before
an image of the Virgin, and
prayed with fervor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forecast.</div>

<p>132. Meanwhile, Falcone had
walked about two-hundred yards
along the path, and stopped at a little
ravine, which he descended. He
sounded the earth with the butt of
his gun and found it soft and easy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
to dig. The spot seemed suitable
for his design.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspense.</div>

<p>133. “Fortunato, go near to that
large rock.”</p>

<p>134. The boy did as he was commanded,
then he knelt down.</p>

<p>135. “Say your prayers.”</p>

<p>136. “Father, Father, do not kill
me!”</p>

<p>137. “Say your prayers!” repeated
Mateo in a terrible voice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Our Father, etc.,” “I
believe in God, etc.”</div>

<p>138. The child, all stammering and
sobbing, repeated the <em>Pater</em> and the
<em>Credo</em>. The father, in a firm voice
responded Amen at the close of each
prayer.</p>

<p>139. “Are those all the prayers
that you know?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Hail Mary, etc.” A liturgical
prayer.</div>

<p>140. “I also know the <em>Ave Maria</em>,
and the <em>Litany</em> that my aunt taught
me, Father.”</p>

<p>141. “It is rather long, but it doesn’t
matter.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note force of “achieved.”</div>

<p>142. The child achieved the <em>Litany</em>
in a faint voice.</p>

<p>143. “Have you finished?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrast with his former
vicious “coolness.”</div>

<p>144. “Oh, Father, Father, mercy!
Pardon me! I will never do it
again! I will beg my cousin the corporal
with all my might for mercy
for Gianetto!”</p>

<p>145. He went on speaking; Mateo
loaded his rifle and took aim as he
said:</p>

<p>146. “May God forgive you!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Full Climax and Denouement.</span></div>

<p>147. The boy made a desperate effort
to get up and clasp his father’s
knees, but he had not time. Mateo
fired, and Fortunato fell dead.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Note force of “throwing.”</div>

<p>148. Without throwing a single
glance at the body, Mateo returned to
his house to fetch a spade with which
to bury his son. He had taken but a
few steps when he met Giuseppa,
who had run out, alarmed by the
sound of the firing.</p>

<p>149. “What have you done?”</p>

<p>150. “Justice!”</p>

<p>151. “Where is he?”</p>

<h3>STEVENSON AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>Robert Lewis Balfour Stevenson, as he was baptized,
was born November 13, 1850, at Edinburgh, Scotland, of
Scotch parents. He entered Edinburgh University when
he was seventeen, intending to learn his father’s profession,
civil engineering&mdash;though he had always longed to
be a writer, having dictated books at the precocious ages
of six, seven, and nine. At twenty-one he decided to
study law, and four years later passed the bar examination
in his native city. In 1880 he married Mrs. Osbourne,
with whose son, Lloyd, he collaborated in the
writing of several stories. Stevenson’s health, which was
never robust, sent him on many journeys in search of
strength&mdash;to the European continent, several times to
the United States, and once on a two years’ voyage to the
South Seas. In 1890 he finally settled in Samoa, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
he died at his home, Vailima, December 3, 1894. He
was buried on the nearby summit of Mount Vaea.</p>

<p>Stevenson was a brilliant novelist, essayist, poet, and
short-story writer. <em>Treasure Island</em>, <em>Kidnapped</em>, <em>The
Master of Ballantrae</em>, and <em>Weir of Hermiston</em>&mdash;the last
of which he left unfinished&mdash;are his best novels. His
journeys were chronicled by such delightful travel-sketches
as <em>An Inland Voyage</em>, <em>Travels With a Donkey</em>,
and <em>The Silverado Squatters</em>. <em>A Child’s Garden of
Verse</em> contains his best poems. His most noteworthy
essays are found in <em>Memories and Portraits</em>, and <em>Familiar
Studies of Men and Books</em>. Most famous among his
short-stories are “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde” (a novelette in length), “The Pavilion on
the Links,” “Thrawn Janet,” “Will o’ the Mill,” “The
Sire de Malétroit’s Door,” “The Merry Men,” “Markheim,”
published first in <em>Unwin’s Annual</em>, London, 1885,
and given in this volume in full, and “A Lodging for the
Night,” which follows entire. It was first published in
<em>The Temple Bar</em> magazine, October, 1877.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stevenson was a supreme craftsman. No writer of
the short-story in English, except Edgar Allan Poe,
was so conscious of his art and so gifted to create up to
the measure of his orderly knowledge. In criticism of
the story-teller’s art, Poe was the greater originator,
Stevenson the more brilliant generalizer; Poe was the
deeper, Stevenson the broader; Poe’s opinions as to form
grew largely out of his own consciousness, and shaped
his practices&mdash;they were arrived at deductively: Stevenson’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
standards grew as his creations shaped themselves,
and were measurably molded by his own writings&mdash;they
were examples of inductive reasoning. Thus Stevenson
was doubly equipped to produce incomparably the
greatest group of short-stories ever written by a Briton
before the days of Kipling, and some sound critics will
dispute even this reservation. In charm, in dash of style,
in a sense of form, in pure romantic spirit, and in penetrating
human interest, Stevenson ranks among the ten
greatest short-story-tellers of his era.</p>


<p class="p1 blockquot">I wonder if any one had ever more energy upon so little
strength?&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. L. Stevenson</span>, <em>Vailima Letters</em>.</p>


<p class="p1 blockquot">In the highest achievements of the art of words, the dramatic
and the pictorial, the moral and romantic interest, rise and fall
together by a common and organic law. Situation is animated
with passion, passion clothed upon with situation. Neither exists
for itself, but each inheres indissolubly with the other. This is
high art; and not only the highest art possible in words, but the
highest art of all, since it combines the greatest mass and
diversity of the elements of truth and pleasure. Such are epics,
and the few prose tales that have the epic weight.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. L.
Stevenson</span>, <em>A Gossip on Romance</em>.</p>


<p class="p1 blockquot">The stories of Stevenson exhibit a double union, as admirable
as it is rare. They exhibit the union of splendid material with
the most delicate skill in language; and they exhibit the union of
thrilling events with a remarkable power of psychological
analysis.&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Lyon Phelps</span>, <em>Essays on Modern Novelists</em>.</p>


<p class="p1 blockquot">Mr. Stevenson enjoys the reputation of being the modern representative
of the romantic school of fiction. There are others
of high repute, for romanticism is now the vogue, but there is
hardly any other whose name we would care to link with that
of Walter Scott.&mdash;<span class="smcap">William H. Sheran</span>, <em>Handbook of Literary
Criticism</em>.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>



<p class="p1 blockquot">Perhaps the first quality in Mr. Stevenson’s works, now so
many and so various, which strikes a reader, is the buoyancy, the
survival of the child in him. He has told the world often, in
prose and verse, how vivid are his memories of his own infancy....
The peculiarity of Mr. Stevenson is not only to have been
a fantastic child, and to retain, in maturity, that fantasy ripened
into imagination: he has also kept up the habit of dramatising
everything, of playing, half consciously, many parts, of making
the world “an unsubstantial fairy place....” It is the eternal
child that drives him to seek adventures and to sojourn among
beach-combers and savages.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Andrew Lang</span>, <em>Essays in Little</em>.</p>

<p class="p1 blockquot">It has been stated that the finer qualities of Stevenson are
called out by the psychological romance on native soil. He did
some brilliant and engaging work of foreign setting and motive....
Judged as art, “The Bottle Imp” and “The Beach of
Falesa” are among the triumphs of ethnic interpretation, let
alone their more external charms of story. And another masterpiece
of foreign setting, “A Lodging for the Night,” is further
proof of Stevenson’s ability to use other than Scotch motives for
the materials of his art.... Few novelists of any race have
beaten this wandering Scot in the power of representing character
and envisaging it, and there can hardly be successful
characterization without this allied power of creating atmosphere.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard
Burton</span>, <em>Masters of the English Novel</em>.</p>


<p class="p1 blockquot">Not until 1877, and Robert Louis Stevenson’s first published
narrative, does any Englishman of real caliber show both
desire and ability to do something <em>new</em> with the short story.
This narrative was “A Lodging for the Night,” published in
<em>Temple Bar</em> for October.... “A Lodging for the Night” is as
clearly and consciously an impressionistic short story as George
Meredith’s contemporary novelettes are not of that category;
the two stories which followed (“Will o’ the Mill” and “The
Sire de Malétroit’s Door”) would assure the most timid critic
of our generation that here was a master in this department of
fiction.... There is “The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde,” that short story thrown over into the form of a detective
romance.... Or there is “Markheim,” a story less powerful in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
execution, but more excellent in workmanship, and an almost
ideal example of the impressionistic short story. Flaubert might
have written the description of the curiosity shop as the murderer
saw it, with its accusing clock-voices, its wavering shadows,
from the inner door “a long slit of daylight like a pointing
finger.” And Flaubert would have praised the skilful gradation
of incident and description, whereby conscience gains and gains
in the struggle for Markheim’s mind. But Hawthorne would
have been prouder still of the plot&mdash;a weak man with a remnant
of high ideals suddenly realizing that his curve is plotted and
can lead him only downwards.... How like to Hawthorne’s
usual way is Stevenson’s determination to make, at all costs, a
moral issue the outcome of his story!... “Will o’ the Mill”
is like a twice-told tale not only in theme; its whole effect is
Hawthornesque. “A Lodging for the Night” has for its kernel
a question of ethics.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. S. Canby</span>, <em>The Short Story in English</em>.

<h3>A LODGING FOR THE NIGHT</h3>

<p class="big05 center">BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON</p>

<p class="p1">It was late in November, 1456.
The snow fell over Paris with rigorous,
relentless persistence; sometimes
the wind made a sally and scattered
it in flying vortices; sometimes there
was a lull, and flake after flake descended
out of the black night air, silent,
circuitous, interminable. To poor
people, looking up under moist eyebrows,
it seemed a wonder where it
all came from. Master Francis Villon
had propounded an alternative
that afternoon, at a tavern window;
was it only Pagan Jupiter plucking
geese upon Olympus? or were the
holy angels moulting? He was only
a poor master of arts, he went on;
and as the question somewhat
touched upon divinity, he durst not
venture to conclude. A silly old
priest from Montargis, who was
among the company, treated the
young rascal to a bottle of wine in
honor of the jest and grimaces with
which it was accompanied, and
swore on his own white beard that he
had been just such another irreverent
dog when he was Villon’s age.</p>

<p>2. The air was raw and pointed,
but not far below freezing; and the
flakes were large, damp, and adhesive.
The whole city was sheeted up.
An army might have marched from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
end to end and not a footfall given
the alarm. If there were any belated
birds in heaven, they saw the island
like a large white patch, and the
bridges like slim white spars, on the
black ground of the river. High up
overhead the snow settled among the
tracery of the cathedral towers.
Many a niche was drifted full; many
a statue wore a long white bonnet
on its grotesque or sainted head.
The gargoyles had been transformed
into great false noses, drooping
toward the point. The crockets were
like upright pillows swollen on one
side. In the intervals of the wind,
there was a dull sound of dripping
about the precincts of the church.</p>

<p>3. The cemetery of St. John had
taken its own share of the snow.
All the graves were decently covered;
tall white housetops stood
around in grave array; worthy
burghers were long ago in bed, be-nightcapped
like their domiciles;
there was no light in all the neighborhood
but a little peep from a
lamp that hung swinging in the
church choir, and tossed the shadows
to and fro in time to its oscillations.
The clock was hard on ten
when the patrol went by with halberds
and a lantern, beating their
hands; and they saw nothing suspicious
about the cemetery of St. John.</p>

<p>4. Yet there was a small house,
backed up against the cemetery wall,
which was still awake, and awake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
to evil purpose, in that snoring district.
There was not much to betray
it from without; only a stream of
warm vapor from the chimney-top,
a patch where the snow melted on the
roof, and a few half-obliterated footprints
at the door. But within, behind
the shuttered windows, Master
Francis Villon, the poet, and some
of the thievish crew with whom he
consorted, were keeping the night
alive and passing round the bottle.</p>

<p>5. A great pile of living embers
diffused a strong and ruddy glow
from the arched chimney. Before
this straddled Dom Nicolas, the
Picardy monk, with his skirts picked
up and his fat legs bared to the
comfortable warmth. His dilated
shadow cut the room in half; and the
firelight only escaped on either side
of his broad person, and in a little
pool between his outspread feet. His
face had the beery, bruised appearance
of the continual drinker’s; it
was covered with a network of congested
veins, purple in ordinary circumstances,
but now pale violet, for
even with his back to the fire the
cold pinched him on the other side.
His cowl had half fallen back, and
made a strange excrescence on either
side of his bull neck. So he straddled,
grumbling, and cut the room in
half with the shadow of his portly
frame.</p>

<p>6. On the right, Villon and Guy
Tabary were huddled together over
a scrap of parchment; Villon making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
a ballad which he was to call the
“Ballad of Roast Fish,” and Tabary
spluttering admiration at his shoulder.
The poet was a rag of a man,
dark, little, and lean, with hollow
cheeks and thin black locks. He carried
his four-and-twenty years with
feverish animation. Greed had made
folds about his eyes, evil smiles had
puckered his mouth. The wolf and
pig struggled together in his face.
It was an eloquent, sharp, ugly, earthly
countenance. His hands were
small and prehensile, with fingers
knotted like a cord; and they were
continually flickering in front of him
in violent and expressive pantomime.
As for Tabary, a broad, complacent,
admiring imbecility breathed from
his squash nose and slobbering lips:
he had become a thief, just as he
might have become the most decent
of burgesses, by the imperious chance
that rules the lives of human geese
and human donkeys.</p>

<p>7. At the monk’s other hand, Montigny
and Thevenin Pensete played
a game of chance. About the first
there clung some flavor of good birth
and training, as about a fallen angel;
something long, lithe, and courtly
in the person; something aquiline and
darkling in the face. Thevenin, poor
soul, was in great feather: he had
done a good stroke of knavery that
afternoon in the Faubourg St.
Jacques, and all night he had been
gaining from Montigny. A flat smile
illuminated his face; his bald head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
shone rosily in a garland of red
curls; his little protuberant stomach
shook with silent chucklings as he
swept in his gains.</p>

<p>8. “Doubles or quits?” said Thevenin.</p>

<p>9. Montigny nodded grimly.</p>

<p>10. “Some may prefer to dine in
state,” wrote Villon, “On bread and
cheese on silver plate. Or, or&mdash;help
me out, Guido!”</p>

<p>11. Tabary giggled.</p>

<p>12. “Or parsley on a golden dish,”
scribbled the poet.</p>

<p>13. The wind was freshening without;
it drove the snow before it, and
sometimes raised its voice in a victorious
whoop, and made sepulchral
grumblings in the chimney. The cold
was growing sharper as the night
went on. Villon, protruding his lips,
imitated the gust with something between
a whistle and a groan. It was
an eerie, uncomfortable talent of the
poet’s, much detested by the Picardy
monk.</p>

<p>14. “Can’t you hear it rattle in the
gibbet?” said Villon. “They are all
dancing the devil’s jig on nothing, up
there. You may dance, my gallants,
you’ll be none the warmer! Whew!
what a gust! Down went somebody
just now! A medlar the fewer on
the three-legged medlar-tree!&mdash;I say,
Dom Nicolas, it’ll be cold to-night
on the St. Denis Road?” he asked.</p>

<p>15. Dom Nicolas winked both his
big eyes, and seemed to choke upon
his Adam’s apple. Montfaucon, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
great grisly Paris gibbet, stood hard
by the St. Denis Road, and the pleasantry
touched him on the raw. As
for Tabary, he laughed immoderately
over the medlars; he had never heard
anything more light-hearted; and he
held his sides and crowed. Villon
fetched him a fillip on the nose, which
turned his mirth into an attack of
coughing.</p>

<p>16. “Oh, stop that row,” said Villon,
“and think of rhymes to ‘fish.’”</p>

<p>17. “Doubles or quits,” said Montigny,
doggedly.</p>

<p>18. “With all my heart,” quoth
Thevenin.</p>

<p>19. “Is there any more in that bottle?”
asked the monk.</p>

<p>20. “Open another,” said Villon.
“How do you ever hope to fill that
big hogshead, your body, with little
things like bottles? And how do you
expect to get to heaven? How many
angels, do you fancy, can be spared
to carry up a single monk from Picardy?
Or do you think yourself another
Elias&mdash;and they’ll send the
coach for you?”</p>

<p>21. “<em>Hominibus impossible</em>,” replied
the monk, as he filled his glass.</p>

<p>22. Tabary was in ecstasies.</p>

<p>23. Villon filliped his nose again.</p>

<p>24. “Laugh at my jokes, if you
like,” he said.</p>

<p>25. “It was very good,” objected
Tabary.</p>

<p>26. Villon made a face at him.
“Think of rhymes to ‘fish,’” he
said. “What have you to do with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Latin? You’ll wish you knew none
of it at the great assizes, when the
devil calls for Guido Tabary, <em>clericus</em>&mdash;the
devil with the humpback and
red-hot finger-nails. Talking of the
devil,” he added, in a whisper,
“look at Montigny!”</p>

<p>27. All three peered covertly at
the gamester. He did not seem to
be enjoying his luck. His mouth
was a little to a side; one nostril
nearly shut, and the other much inflated.
The black dog was on his
back, as people say in terrifying
nursery metaphor; and he breathed
hard under the grewsome burden.</p>

<p>28. “He looks as if he could knife
him,” whispered Tabary, with round
eyes.</p>

<p>29. The monk shuddered, and
turned his face and spread his open
hands to the red embers. It was
the cold that thus affected Dom
Nicolas, and not any excess of moral
sensibility.</p>

<p>30. “Come, now,” said Villon&mdash;“about
this ballad. How does it
run so far?” And beating time with
his hand he read it aloud to Tabary.</p>

<p>31. They were interrupted at the
fourth rhyme by a brief and fatal
movement among the gamesters.
The round was completed, and Thevenin
was just opening his mouth to
claim another victory, when Montigny
leaped up, swift as an adder,
and stabbed him to the heart. The
blow took effect before he had time
to move. A tremor or two convulsed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
his frame; his hands opened and shut,
his heels rattled on the floor; then
his head rolled backward over one
shoulder with the eyes wide open;
and Thevenin Pensete’s spirit had returned
to Him who gave it.</p>

<p>32. Everyone sprung to his feet;
but the business was over in two
twos. The four living fellows looked
at each other in rather a ghastly
fashion; the dead man contemplating
a corner of the roof with a singular
and ugly leer.</p>

<p>33. “My God!” said Tabary; and
he began to pray in Latin.</p>

<p>34. Villon broke out into hysterical
laughter. He came a step forward
and ducked a ridiculous bow at Thevenin,
and laughed still louder.
Then he sat down suddenly, all of a
heap, upon a stool, and continued
laughing bitterly as though he
would shake himself to pieces.</p>

<p>35. Montigny recovered his composure
first.</p>

<p>36. “Let’s see what he has about
him,” he remarked; and he picked
the dead man’s pockets with a practiced
hand, and divided the money
into four equal portions on the table.
“There’s for you,” he said.</p>

<p>37. The monk received his share
with a deep sigh, and a single
stealthy glance at the dead Thevenin,
who was beginning to sink himself
and topple sideways off the chair.</p>

<p>38. “We’re all in for it,” cried Villon,
swallowing his mirth. “It’s a
hanging job for every man jack of us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
that’s here&mdash;not to speak of those
who aren’t.” He made a shocking
gesture in the air with his raised
right hand, and put out his tongue
and threw his head on one side, so
as to counterfeit the appearance of
one who has been hanged. Then he
pocketed his share of the spoil, and
executed a shuffle with his feet as if
to restore the circulation.</p>

<p>39. Tabary was the last to help
himself; he made a dash at the
money, and retired to the other end
of the apartment.</p>

<p>40. Montigny stuck Thevenin upright
in the chair, and drew out a
dagger, which was followed by a jet
of blood.</p>

<p>41. “You fellows had better be
moving,” he said, as he wiped the
blade on his victim’s doublet.</p>

<p>42. “I think we had,” returned
Villon, with a great gulp. “Damn
his fat head!” he broke out. “It
sticks in my throat like phlegm.
What right has a man to have red
hair when he is dead?” And he fell
all of a heap again upon the stool,
and fairly covered his face with his
hands.</p>

<p>43. Montigny and Dom Nicolas
laughed aloud, even Tabary feebly
chiming in.</p>

<p>44. “Cry baby,” said the monk.</p>

<p>45. “I always said he was a woman,”
added Montigny, with a sneer.
“Sit up, can’t you?” he went on,
giving another shake to the murdered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
body. “Tread out that fire,
Nick!”</p>

<p>46. But Nick was better employed;
he was quietly taking Villon’s purse,
as the poet sat, limp and trembling,
on the stool where he had been making
a ballad not three minutes before.
Montigny and Tabary dumbly demanded
a share of the booty, which
the monk silently promised as he
passed the little bag into the bosom
of his gown. In many ways an artistic
nature unfits a man for practical
existence.</p>

<p>47. No sooner had the theft been
accomplished than Villon shook himself,
jumped to his feet, and began
helping to scatter and extinguish the
embers. Meanwhile Montigny opened
the door and cautiously peered into
the street. The coast was clear;
there was no meddlesome patrol in
sight. Still it was judged wiser to
slip out severally; and as Villon was
himself in a hurry to escape from the
neighborhood of the dead Thevenin,
and the rest were in a still greater
hurry to get rid of him before he
should discover the loss of his
money, he was the first by general
consent to issue forth into the street.</p>

<p>48. The wind had triumphed and
swept all the clouds from heaven.
Only a few vapors, as thin as moonlight,
fleeted rapidly across the stars.
It was bitter cold; and by a common
optical effect, things seemed almost
more definite than in the broadest
daylight. The sleeping city was absolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
still; a company of white
hoods, a field full of little alps, below
the twinkling stars. Villon cursed
his fortune. Would it were still
snowing! Now, wherever he went,
he left an indelible trail behind him
on the glittering streets; wherever he
went he was still tethered to the
house by the cemetery of St. John;
wherever he went he must weave,
with his own plodding feet, the rope
that bound him to the crime and
would bind him to the gallows. The
leer of the dead man came back to
him with a new significance. He
snapped his fingers as if to pluck up
his own spirits, and choosing a street
at random, stepped boldly forward in
the snow.</p>

<p>49. Two things preoccupied him
as he went; the aspect of the gallows
at Montfaucon in this bright, windy
phase of the night’s existence, for
one; and for another, the look of
the dead man with his bald head and
garland of red curls. Both struck
cold upon his heart, and he kept
quickening his pace as if he could
escape from unpleasant thoughts by
mere fleetness of foot. Sometimes
he looked back over his shoulder
with a sudden nervous jerk; but he
was the only moving thing in the
white streets, except when the wind
swooped round a corner and threw
up the snow, which was beginning to
freeze, in spouts of glittering dust.</p>

<p>50. Suddenly he saw, a long way
before him, a black clump and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
couple of lanterns. The clump was
in motion, and the lanterns swung as
though carried by men walking. It
was a patrol. And though it was
merely crossing his line of march, he
judged it wiser to get out of eyeshot
as speedily as he could. He was not
in the humor to be challenged, and
he was conscious of making a very
conspicuous mark upon the snow.
Just on his left hand there stood a
great hotel, with some turrets and a
large porch before the door; it was
half-ruinous, he remembered, and
had long stood empty; and so he
made three steps of it, and jumped
into the shelter of the porch. It was
pretty dark inside, after the glimmer
of the snowy streets, and he was
groping forward with outspread
hands, when he stumbled over some
substance which offered an indescribable
mixture of resistances, hard
and soft, firm and loose. His heart
gave a leap, and he sprung two steps
back and stared dreadfully at the
obstacle. Then he gave a little laugh
of relief. It was only a woman, and
she dead. He knelt beside her to
make sure upon this latter point.
She was freezing cold, and rigid like
a stick. A little ragged finery fluttered
in the wind about her hair, and
her cheeks had been heavily rouged
that same afternoon. Her pockets
were quite empty; but in her stocking,
underneath the garter, Villon
found two of the small coins that
went by the name of whites. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
little enough, but it was always something,
and the poet was moved with
a deep sense of pathos that she
should have died before she had
spent her money. That seemed to
him a dark and pitiful mystery; and
he looked from the coins in his hand
to the dead woman, and back again
to the coins, shaking his head over
the riddle of man’s life.</p>

<p>51. Henry V. of England, dying
at Vincennes just after he had conquered
France, and this poor jade
cut off by a cold draught in a great
man’s doorway, before she had time
to spend her couple of whites&mdash;it
seemed a cruel way to carry on the
world. Two whites would have taken
such a little while to squander;
and yet it would have been one more
good taste in the mouth, one more
smack of the lips, before the devil got
the soul, and the body was left to
birds and vermin. He would like to
use all his tallow before the light
was blown out and the lantern broken.</p>

<p>52. While these thoughts were
passing through his mind, he was
feeling, half mechanically, for his
purse. Suddenly his heart stopped
beating; a feeling of cold scales passed
up the back of his legs, and a cold
blow seemed to fall upon his scalp.
He stood petrified for a moment;
then he felt again with one feverish
movement; and then his loss burst
upon him, and he was covered at
once with perspiration. To spend-thrifts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
money is so living and actual&mdash;it
is such a thin veil between them
and their pleasures! There is only
one limit to their fortune&mdash;that of
time; and a spendthrift with only a
few crowns is the Emperor of Rome
until they are spent. For such a
person to lose his money is to suffer
the most shocking reverse, and fall
from heaven to hell, from all to nothing,
in a breath. And all the more
if he has put his head in the halter
for it; if he may be hanged to-morrow
for that same purse, so dearly
earned, so foolishly departed! Villon
stood and cursed; he threw the
two whites into the street; he shook
his fist at heaven; he stamped, and
was not horrified to find himself
trampling the poor corpse. Then he
began rapidly to retrace his steps toward
the house beside the cemetery.
He had forgotten all fear of the
patrol, which was long gone by at
any rate, and had no idea but that
of his lost purse. It was in vain
that he looked right and left upon
the snow; nothing was to be seen.
He had not dropped it in the streets.
Had it fallen in the house? He
would have liked dearly to go in and
see; but the idea of the grisly occupant
unmanned him. And he saw
besides, as he drew near, that their
efforts to put out the fire had been
unsuccessful; on the contrary, it had
broken into a blaze, and a changeful
light played in the chinks of door
and window, and revived his terror<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
for the authorities and Paris gibbet.</p>

<p>53. He returned to the hotel with
the porch, and groped about upon the
snow for the money he had thrown
away in his childish passion. But
he could only find one white; the
other had probably struck sideways
and sunk deeply in. With a single
white in his pocket, all his projects
for a rousing night in some wild
tavern vanished utterly away. And
it was not only pleasure that fled
laughing from his grasp; positive
discomfort, positive pain, attacked
him as he stood ruefully before the
porch. His perspiration had dried
upon him, and although the wind
had now fallen, a binding frost was
setting in stronger with every hour,
and he felt benumbed and sick at
heart. What was to be done? Late
as was the hour, improbable as was
success, he would try the house of
his adopted father, the chaplain of
St. Benoit.</p>

<p>54. He ran there all the way, and
knocked timidly. There was no answer.
He knocked again and again,
taking heart with every stroke; and
at last steps were heard approaching
from within. A barred wicket
fell open in the iron-studded door,
and emitted a gush of yellow light.</p>

<p>55. “Hold up your face to the
wicket,” said the chaplain, from within.</p>

<p>56. “It’s only me,” whimpered
Villon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>57. “Oh, it’s only you, is it?” returned
the chaplain; and he cursed
him with foul unpriestly oaths for
disturbing him at such an hour, and
bade him be off to hell, where he
came from.</p>

<p>58. “My hands are blue to the
wrist,” pleaded Villon; “my feet are
dead and full of twinges; my nose
aches with the sharp air; the cold
lies at my heart. I may be dead before
morning. Only this once, father,
and before God, I will never ask
again!”</p>

<p>59. “You should have come earlier,”
said the ecclesiastic coolly.
“Young men require a lesson now
and then.” He shut the wicket and
retired deliberately into the interior
of the house.</p>

<p>60. Villon was beside himself; he
beat upon the door with his hands
and feet, and shouted hoarsely after
the chaplain.</p>

<p>61. “Wormy old fox!” he cried.
“If I had my hand under your twist,
I would send you flying headlong
into the bottomless pit.”</p>

<p>62. A door shut in the interior,
faintly audible to the poet down long
passages. He passed his hand over
his mouth with an oath. And then
the humor of the situation struck
him, and he laughed and looked lightly
up to heaven, where the stars seemed
to be winking over his discomfiture.</p>

<p>63. What was to be done? It
looked very like a night in the frosty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
streets. The idea of the dead woman
popped into his imagination, and
gave him a hearty fright; what had
happened to her in the early night
might very well happen to him before
morning. And he so young! and
with such immense possibilities of
disorderly amusement before him!
He felt quite pathetic over the notion
of his own fate, as if it had been
some one else’s, and made a little
imaginative vignette of the scene in
the morning when they should find
his body.</p>

<p>64. He passed all his chances under
review, turning the white between
his thumb and forefinger. Unfortunately
he was on bad terms with
some old friends who would once
have taken pity on him in such a
plight. He had lampooned them in
verses; he had beaten and cheated
them; and yet now, when he was in
so close a pinch, he thought there
was at least one who might perhaps
relent. It was a chance. It was
worth trying at least, and he would
go and see.</p>

<p>65. On the way two little accidents
happened to him which colored his
musings in a very different manner.
For, first he fell in with the track of
a patrol, and walked in it for some
hundred yards, although it lay out
of his direction. And this spirited
him up; at least he had confused his
trail; for he was still possessed with
the idea of people tracking him all
about Paris over the snow, and collaring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
him next morning before he
was awake. The other matter affected
him quite differently. He passed
a street corner, where, not so long
before, a woman and her child had
been devoured by wolves. This was
just the kind of weather, he reflected,
when wolves might take it into
their heads to enter Paris again; and
a lone man in these deserted streets
would run the chance of something
worse than a mere scare. He stopped
and looked upon the place with
an unpleasant interest&mdash;it was a
center where several lanes intersected
each other; and he looked down
them all, one after another, and held
his breath to listen, lest he should detect
some galloping black things on
the snow or hear the sound of howling
between him and the river. He
remembered his mother telling him
the story and pointing out the spot,
while he was yet a child. His mother!
If he only knew where she lived,
he might make sure at least of
shelter. He determined he would inquire
upon the morrow; nay, he
would go and see her too, poor old
girl! So thinking, he arrived at his
destination&mdash;his last hope for the
night.</p>

<p>66. The house was quite dark, like
its neighbors; and yet after a few
taps, he heard a movement overhead,
a door opening, and a cautious voice
asking who was there. The poet
named himself in a loud whisper, and
waited, not without some trepidation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
the result. Nor had he to wait long.
A window was suddenly opened, and
a pailful of slops splashed down upon
the doorstep. Villon had not
been unprepared for something of the
sort, and had put himself as much in
shelter as the nature of the porch
admitted; but for all that, he was
deplorably drenched below the waist.
His hose began to freeze almost at
once. Death from cold and exposure
stared him in the face; he remembered
he was of phthisical tendency, and
began coughing tentatively. But
the gravity of the danger steadied his
nerves. He stopped a few hundred
yards from the door where he had
been so rudely used, and reflected
with his nose. He could only see
one way of getting a lodging, and
that was to take it. He had noticed
a house not far away, which looked
as if it might be easily broken into,
and thither he betook himself promptly,
entertaining himself on the way
with the idea of a room still hot, with
a table still loaded with the remains
of supper, where he might pass the
rest of the black hours and whence
he should issue, on the morrow, with
an armful of valuable plate. He even
considered on what viands and what
wines he should prefer; and as he
was calling the roll of his favorite
dainties, roast fish presented itself to
his mind with an odd mixture of
amusement and horror.</p>

<p>67. “I shall never finish that ballad,”
he thought to himself; and then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
with another shudder at the recollection,
“Oh, damn his fat head!” he
repeated fervently, and spat upon the
snow.</p>

<p>68. The house in question looked
dark at first sight; but as Villon
made a preliminary inspection in
search of the handiest point of attack,
a little twinkle of light caught his
eye from behind a curtained window.</p>

<p>69. “The devil!” he thought.
“People awake! Some student or
some saint, confound the crew!
Can’t they get drunk and lie in bed
snoring like their neighbors! What’s
the good of curfew, and poor devils
of bellringers jumping at a rope’s end
in bell-towers? What’s the use of
day, if people sit up all night! The
gripes to them!” He grinned as he
saw where his logic was leading him.
“Every man to his business, after
all,” added he, “and if they’re awake,
by the Lord, I may come by a supper
honestly for once, and cheat the
devil.”</p>

<p>70. He went boldly to the door and
knocked with an assured hand. On
both previous occasions, he had
knocked timidly and with some dread
of attracting notice; but now, when
he had just discarded the thought of
a burglarious entry, knocking at a
door seemed a mighty simple and innocent
proceeding. The sound of his
blows echoed through the house with
thin, phantasmal reverberations, as
though the house were empty; but
these had scarcely died away before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
a measured tread drew near, a couple
of bolts were withdrawn, and one
wing was opened broadly, as though
no guile or fear of guile were known
to those within. A tall figure of a
man, muscular and spare, but a little
bent, confronted Villon. The head
was massive in bulk, but finely sculptured;
the nose blunt at the bottom,
but refining upward to where it joined
a pair of strong and honest eyebrows;
the mouth and eyes surrounded
with delicate markings, and the
whole face based upon a thick white
beard, boldly and squarely trimmed.
Seen as it was by the light of a flickering
hand-lamp, it looked, perhaps,
nobler than it had a right to do; but
it was a fine face, honorable rather
than intelligent, strong, simple, and
righteous.</p>

<p>71. “You knock late, sir,” said the
old man, in resonant, courteous tones.</p>

<p>72. Villon cringed, and brought up
many servile words of apology; at a
crisis of this sort, the beggar was uppermost
in him, and the man of
genius hid his head with confusion.</p>

<p>73. “You are cold,” repeated the
old man, “and hungry? Well, step
in.” And he ordered him into the
house with a noble enough gesture.</p>

<p>74. “Some great seigneur,” thought
Villon, as his host, setting down the
lamp on the flagged pavement of the
entry, shot the bolts once more into
their places.</p>

<p>75. “You will pardon me if I go in
front,” he said, when this was done;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and he preceded the poet up-stairs
into a large apartment, warmed with
a pan of charcoal and lit by a great
lamp hanging from the roof. It was
very bare of furniture; only some
gold plate on a sideboard; some
folios; and a stand of armor between
the windows. Some smart tapestry
hung upon the walls, representing the
crucifixion of our Lord in one piece,
and in another a scene of shepherds
and shepherdesses by a running
stream. Over the chimney was a
shield of arms.</p>

<p>76. “Will you seat yourself,” said
the old man, “and forgive me if I
leave you? I am alone in my house
to-night, and if you are to eat I must
forage for you myself.”</p>

<p>77. No sooner was his host gone
than Villon leaped from the chair on
which he had just seated himself,
and began examining the room, with
the stealth and passion of a cat. He
weighed the gold flagons in his hand,
opened all the folios, and investigated
the arms upon the shield, and the
stuff with which the seats were lined.
He raised the window curtains, and
saw that the windows were set with
rich stained glass in figures, so far
as he could see, of martial import.
Then he stood in the middle of the
room, drew a long breath, and, retaining
it with puffed cheeks, looked
round and round him, turning on his
heels, as if to impress every feature
of the apartment on his memory.</p>

<p>78. “Seven pieces of plate,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
said. “If there had been ten, I
would have risked it. A fine house,
and a fine old master, so help me all
the saints!”</p>

<p>79. And just then, hearing the old
man’s tread returning along the corridor,
he stole back to his chair, and
began humbly toasting his wet legs
before the charcoal pan.</p>

<p>80. His entertainer had a plate of
meat in one hand and a jug of wine
in the other. He sat down the plate
upon the table, motioning Villon to
draw in his chair, and, going to the
sideboard, brought back two goblets,
which he filled.</p>

<p>81. “I drink your better fortune,”
he said, gravely touching Villon’s cup
with his own.</p>

<p>82. “To our better acquaintance,”
said the poet, growing bold. A mere
man of the people would have been
awed by the courtesy of the old
seigneur, but Villon was hardened in
that matter; he had made mirth for
great lords before now, and found
them as black rascals as himself.
And so he devoted himself to the
viands with a ravenous gusto, while
the old man, leaning backward, watched
him with steady, curious eyes.</p>

<p>83. “You have blood on your
shoulder, my man,” he said.</p>

<p>84. Montigny must have laid his
wet right hand upon him as he left
the house. He cursed Montigny in
his heart.</p>

<p>85. “It was none of my shedding,”
he stammered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>86. “I had not supposed so,” returned
his host, quietly. “A brawl?”</p>

<p>87. “Well, something of that sort,”
Villon admitted with a quaver.</p>

<p>88. “Perhaps a fellow murdered?”</p>

<p>89. “Oh, no, not murdered,” said
the poet, more and more confused.
“It was all fair play&mdash;murdered by
accident. I had no hand in it, God
strike me dead!” he added, fervently.</p>

<p>90. “One rogue the fewer, I dare
say,” observed the master of the
house.</p>

<p>91. “You may dare to say that,”
agreed Villon, infinitely relieved. “As
big a rogue as there is between here
and Jerusalem. He turned up his
toes like a lamb. But it was a nasty
thing to look at. I dare say you’ve
seen dead men in your time, my
lord?” he added, glancing at the armor.</p>

<p>92. “Many,” said the old man. “I
have followed the wars, as you imagine.”</p>

<p>93. Villon laid down his knife and
fork, which he had just taken up
again.</p>

<p>94. “Were any of them bald?” he
asked.</p>

<p>95. “Oh, yes, and with hair as
white as mine.”</p>

<p>96. “I don’t think I should mind
the white so much,” said Villon.
“His was red.” And he had a return
of his shuddering and tendency
to laughter, which he drowned with
a great draught of wine. “I’m a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
put out when I think of it,” he
went on. “I knew him&mdash;damn him!
And then the cold gives a man fancies&mdash;or
the fancies give a man cold,
I don’t know which.”</p>

<p>97. “Have you any money?” asked
the old man.</p>

<p>98. “I have one white,” returned
the poet, laughing. “I got it out of
a dead jade’s stocking in a porch.
She was as dead as Cæsar, poor
wench, and as cold as a church, with
bits of ribbon sticking in her hair.
This is a hard world in winter for
wolves and wenches and poor rogues
like me.”</p>

<p>99. “I,” said the old man, “am
Enguerrand de la Feuillee, seigneur
de Brisetout, bailly du Patatrac.
Who and what may you be?”</p>

<p>100. Villon rose and made a suitable
reverence. “I am called Francis
Villon,” he said, “a poor master of
arts in this university. I know some
Latin, and a deal of vice. I can make
chansons, ballads, lais, virelais, and
roundels and I am very fond of wine.
I was born in a garret and I shall
not improbably die upon the gallows.
I may add, my lord, that from this
night forward I am your lordship’s
very obsequious servant to command.”</p>

<p>101. “No servant of mine,” said
the knight; “my guest for this evening,
and no more.”</p>

<p>102. “A very grateful guest,” said
Villon, politely, and he drank in
dumb show to his entertainer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>103. “You are shrewd,” began the
old man, tapping his forehead, “very
shrewd; you have learning; you are
a clerk; and yet you take a small
piece of money off a dead woman
in the street. Is it not a kind of
theft?”</p>

<p>104. “It is a kind of theft much
practiced in the wars, my lord.”</p>

<p>105. “The wars are the field of
honor,” returned the old man, proudly.
“There a man plays his life upon
the cast; he fights in the name of his
lord the king, his Lord God, and all
their lordships the holy saints and
angels.”</p>

<p>106. “Put it,” said Villon, “that I
were really a thief, should I not play
my life also, and against heavier
odds?”</p>

<p>107. “For gain, but not for honor.”</p>

<p>108. “Gain?” repeated Villon, with
a shrug. “Gain! The poor fellow
wants supper, and takes it. So does
the soldier in a campaign. Why,
what are all these requisitions we
hear so much about? If they are not
gain to those who take them, they are
loss enough to the others. The men-at-arms
drink by a good fire, while
the burgher bites his nails to buy
them wine and wood. I have seen a
good many plowmen swinging on
trees about the country; ay, I have
seen thirty on one elm, and a very
poor figure they made; and when I
asked some one how all these came
to be hanged, I was told it was because
they could not scrape together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
enough crowns to satisfy the men-at-arms.”</p>

<p>109. “These things are a necessity
of war, which the low-born must endure
with constancy. It is true that
some captains drive overhard; there
are spirits in every rank not easily
moved by pity; and indeed many follow
arms who are no better than
brigands.”</p>

<p>110. “You see,” said the poet, “you
cannot separate the soldier from the
brigand; and what is a thief but an
isolated brigand with circumspect
manners? I steal a couple of mutton
chops, without so much as disturbing
people’s sleep; the farmer grumbles a
bit, but sups none the less wholesomely
on what remains. You come
up blowing gloriously on a trumpet,
take away the whole sheep, and beat
the farmer pitifully into the bargain.
I have no trumpet; I am only Tom,
Dick, or Harry; I am a rogue and a
dog, and hanging’s too good for me&mdash;with
all my heart; but just ask the
farmer which of us he prefers, just
find out which of us he lies awake to
curse on cold nights.”</p>

<p>111. “Look at us two,” said his
lordship. “I am old, strong, and
honored. If I were turned from my
house to-morrow, hundreds would be
proud to shelter me. Poor people
would go out and pass the night in
the streets with their children, if I
merely hinted that I wished to be
alone. And I find you up, wandering
homeless, and picking farthings off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
dead women by the wayside! I fear
no man and nothing; I have seen you
tremble and lose countenance at a
word. I wait God’s summons contentedly
in my own house, or, if it
please the king to call me out again,
upon the field of battle. You look
for the gallows; a rough, swift death,
without hope or honor. Is there no
difference between these two?”</p>

<p>112. “As far as to the moon,” Villon
acquiesced. “But if I had been
born Lord of Brisetout, and you had
been the poor scholar Francis, would
the difference have been any the less?
Should I not have been warming my
knees at this charcoal pan, and would
not you have been groping for farthings
in the snow? Should not I
have been the soldier and you the
thief?”</p>

<p>113. “A thief?” cried the old man.
“I a thief! If you understood your
words you would repent them.”</p>

<p>114. Villon turned out his hands
with a gesture of inimitable impudence.
“If your lordship had done
me the honor to follow my argument!”
he said.</p>

<p>115. “I do you too much honor in
submitting to your presence,” said the
knight. “Learn to curb your tongue
when you speak with old and honorable
men, or some one hastier than I
may reprove you in a sharper fashion.”
And he rose and paced the
lower end of the apartment, struggling
with anger and antipathy. Villon
surreptitiously refilled his cup,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and settled himself more comfortably
in the chair, crossing his knees and
leaning his head upon one hand and
the elbow against the back of the
chair. He was now replete and
warm, and he was in nowise frightened
for his host, having gauged him
as justly as was possible between two
such different characters. The night
was far spent, and in a very comfortable
fashion after all; and he felt
morally certain of a safe departure
on the morrow.</p>

<p>116. “Tell me one thing,” said the
old man, pausing in his walk. “Are
you really a thief?”</p>

<p>117. “I claim the sacred rights of
hospitality,” returned the poet. “My
lord, I am.”</p>

<p>118. “You are very young,” the
knight continued.</p>

<p>119. “I should never have been so
old,” replied Villon, showing his fingers,
“if I had not helped myself
with these ten talents. They have
been my nursing mothers and my
nursing fathers.”</p>

<p>120. “You may still repent and
change.”</p>

<p>121. “I repent daily,” said the poet.
“There are few people more given to
repentance than poor Francis. As
for change, let somebody change my
circumstances. A man must continue
to eat, if it were only that he may
continue to repent.”</p>

<p>122. “The change must begin in
the heart,” returned the old man solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>123. “My dear lord,” answered
Villon, “do you really fancy that I
steal for pleasure? I hate stealing,
like any other piece of work or of
danger. My teeth chatter when I see
a gallows. But I must eat, I must
drink, I must mix in society of some
sort. What the devil! Man is not a
solitary animal&mdash;<em>Cui Deus fœminam
tradit</em>. Make me king’s pantler&mdash;make
me abbot of St. Denis; make
me bailly of the Patatrac; and then I
shall be changed indeed. But as long
as you leave me the poor scholar
Francis Villon, without a farthing,
why, of course, I remain the same.”</p>

<p>124. “The grace of God is all-powerful.”</p>

<p>125. “I should be a heretic to question
it,” said Francis. “It has made
you lord of Brisetout and bailly of
the Patatrac; it has given me nothing
but the quick wits under my hat and
these ten toes upon my hands. May
I help myself to wine? I thank you
respectfully. By God’s grace, you
have a very superior vintage.”</p>

<p>126. The lord of Brisetout walked
to and fro with his hands behind his
back. Perhaps he was not yet quite
settled in his mind about the parallel
between thieves and soldiers; perhaps
Villon had interested him by some
cross-thread of sympathy; perhaps his
wits were simply muddled by so much
unfamiliar reasoning; but whatever
the cause, he somehow yearned to
convert the young man to a better
way of thinking, and could not make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
up his mind to drive him forth again
into the street.</p>

<p>127. “There is something more
than I can understand in this,” he
said at length. “Your mouth is full
of subtleties, and the devil has led
you very far astray; but the devil
is only a very weak spirit before
God’s truth, and all his subtleties
vanish at a word of true honor, like
darkness at morning. Listen to me
once more. I learned long ago that
a gentleman should live chivalrously
and lovingly to God, and the king,
and his lady; and though I have
seen many strange things done, I
have still striven to command my
ways upon that rule. It is not only
written in all noble histories, but in
every man’s heart, if he will take
care to read. You speak of food
and wine, and I know very well that
hunger is a difficult trial to endure;
but you do not speak of other wants;
you say nothing of honor, of faith
to God and other men, of courtesy,
of love without reproach. It may be
that I am not very wise&mdash;and yet I
am&mdash;but you seem to me like one
who has lost his way and made a
great error in life. You are attending
to the little wants, and you have
totally forgotten the great and only
real ones, like a man who should be
doctoring toothache on the Judgment
Day. For such things as honor
and love and faith are not only
nobler than food and drink, but indeed
I think we desire them more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
and suffer more sharply for their
absence. I speak to you as I think
you will most easily understand me.
Are you not while careful to fill
your belly, disregarding another appetite
in your heart, which spoils
the pleasure of your life and keeps
you continually wretched?”</p>

<p>128. Villon was sensibly nettled
under all this sermonizing. “You
think I have no sense of honor!”
he cried. “I’m poor enough, God
knows! It’s hard to see rich people
with their gloves, and you blowing
in your hands. An empty belly is a
bitter thing, although you speak so
lightly of it. If you had had as
many as I, perhaps you would
change your tune. Any way, I’m a
thief&mdash;make the most of that&mdash;but
I’m not a devil from hell, God strike
me dead. I would have you to
know I’ve an honor of my own, as
good as yours, though I don’t prate
about it all day long, as if it was
a God’s miracle to have any. It
seems quite natural to me; I keep
it in its box till it’s wanted. Why,
now, look you here, how long have
I been in this room with you? Did
you not tell me you were alone in
the house? Look at your gold plate!
You’re strong, if you like, but you’re
old and unarmed, and I have my
knife. What did I want but a jerk
of the elbow and here would have
been you with the cold steel in your
bowels, and there would have been
me, linking in the streets, with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
armful of golden cups! Did you
suppose I hadn’t wit enough to see
that? And I scorned the action.
There are your damned goblets as
safe as in a church, there are you
with your heart ticking as good as
new, and here am I, ready to go out
again as poor as I came in, with
my one white that you threw in my
teeth! And you think I have no
sense of honor&mdash;God strike me
dead!”</p>

<p>129. The old man stretched out
his right arm. “I will tell you what
you are,” he said. “You are a
rogue, my man, an impudent and
black-hearted rogue and vagabond.
I have passed an hour with you.
Oh! believe me, I feel myself disgraced!
And you have eaten and
drunk at my table. But now I am
sick at your presence; the day has
come, and the night-bird should be
off to his roost. Will you go before,
or after?”</p>

<p>130. “Which you please,” returned
the poet, rising. “I believe you
to be strictly honorable.” He
thoughtfully emptied his cup. “I
wish I could add you were intelligent,”
he went on, knocking on his
head with his knuckles. “Age! age!
the brains stiff and rheumatic.”</p>

<p>131. The old man preceded him
from a point of self-respect; Villon
followed, whistling, with his thumbs
in his girdle.</p>

<p>132. “God pity you!” said the lord
of Brisetout at the door.</p>

<p>133. “Good-bye, papa,” returned
Villon, with a yawn. “Many thanks
for the cold mutton.”</p>

<p>134. The door closed behind him.
The dawn was breaking over the
white roofs. A chill, uncomfortable
morning ushered in the day. Villon
stood and heartily stretched himself
in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>135. “A very dull old gentleman,”
he thought. “I wonder what his
goblets may be worth.”</p>

<p class="p2">The fact is ... that, in the riddle story, the detective was an
after-thought, or, more accurately, a <em>deus ex machina</em> to make the
story go. The riddle had to be unriddled; and who could do it
so naturally and readily as a detective? The detective, as Poe
saw him, was a means to this end; and it was only afterwards
that writers perceived his availability as a character. Lecoq
accordingly becomes a figure in fiction, and Sherlock, while he
was as yet a novelty, was nearly as attractive as the complications
in which he involved himself.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Julian Hawthorne</span>, Introduction

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The literature of ghosts is very ancient. In visions of the
night, and in the lurid vapors of mystic incantations, figures rise
and smile, or frown and disappear. The Witch of Endor murmurs
her spell, and “an old man cometh up, and he is covered
with a mantle.” Macbeth takes a bond of fate, and from Hecate’s
caldron, after the apparition of an armed head and that of a
bloody child, “an apparition of a child crowned, with a tree in
his hand, rises.” The wizard recounts to Lochiel his warning
vision, and Lochiel departs to his doom. There are stories of
the Castle of Otranto and of The Three Spaniards, and the
infinite detail of “singular experiences,” which make our conscious
daily life the frontier and border-land of an impinging
world of mystery.&mdash;<span class="smcap">George William Curtis</span>, Introduction to

<h3>STORIES OF MYSTERY AND FANTASY</h3>
</div>


<p>Even more deeply seated and elemental than our love
for the mysterious is our passion for undertaking its
solution. It is this, doubtless, that challenges us to match
our wits with the clever rogues of fiction, and to pit
our resources of detection against the forces seen and
unseen which play in tales of the weird, the mysterious,
and the unexplained.</p>

<p>Such stories readily fall into two classes, with as many
sub-sorts as the invention of man may compass&mdash;those
which are soluble and those which are not. Of the former,
the detective story is the more common, followed at
no very great distance by the tale which seems to involve
the supernatural, but whose mystery transpires quite
plainly in the end. Of the latter are all those inexplicable
wonder-fictions dealing with shapes that haunt the
dream-dusk, the whole shadow-land of wraiths and
spirits and presences and immaterialities which cross the
borders of experience at the call of fantasy. They are
all the inheritance of the credulous age in which romance
was born, and few of us are so engirded with the
armor of stoicism that we cannot enjoy their gathering
goose-flesh and creeping spinal chill. Hawthorne and
Poe and Irving were masters here.</p>

<p>The processes of inductive reasoning by which Voltaire’s
Zadig reconstructed actual occurrences from
trivial clues have developed into modern detective stories
of uncounted variety, in which the criminal is hunted
down by a professional sleuth. Then, too, the “clever
amateur” often takes a hand in the game, and even accident
plays at times, until there is no end to the possible
combinations growing out of pure reasoning employed to
unravel the tangle.</p>

<p>Much the same processes are employed to discover the
pseudo-supernatural mystery, like Fitz-James O’Brien’s
solved ghost-story, “What Was It? A Mystery.” But
when we enter the domain of the unexplained, the story
tends to become a study of fear and of pure mystery, like
Marion Crawford’s “The Upper Berth,” and “The
Damned Thing,” by Ambrose Bierce.</p>

<p>Poe was the great American originator of the detective
story, and to-day his “Purloined Letter,” reproduced here
in full, “The Mystery of Marie Rogêt,” and “The Murders
in the Rue Morgue,” are unsurpassed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>
<h3>POE AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p class="p1">Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston, January 19,
1809. His father, of a good Maryland family, was an
actor, and his mother an actress of English extraction.
Both parents dying before Edgar was three, he, with his
brother William and sister Rosalie, was left homeless in
Richmond, where each found a protector. Mrs. Allan
adopted Edgar, giving him his middle name, and bestowing
at the same time every opportunity that wealth could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
offer. He was sent to school at Stoke Newington, England,
attended a private school in Richmond, and entered
the University of Virginia, but remained there less than
a year, for his reckless and erratic temperament champed
under the restraints of routine. He was placed in Mr.
Allan’s counting-room, but ran away to enlist in the
United States Army as “Edgar Allan Perry.” After the
death of Mrs. Allan, her husband secured Poe’s discharge
from the army and his appointment to West Point as a
cadet, July 1, 1830; but after six months Poe contrived
to be dismissed. He had already published his poems
successfully, so he went to New York, in the early part
of 1831, to begin his professional literary life. For four
years&mdash;1833 to 1837&mdash;he wrote brilliantly for <em>The
Southern Literary Messenger</em>, in Baltimore. Then he
went successively to New York and Philadelphia, where
he worked on various literary enterprises for six years.
In 1844 he returned to New York, and became assistant
to N. P. Willis, in whose journal, <em>The Mirror</em>, “The
Raven” appeared in 1845. Poe’s literary reputation was
now established both in America and abroad, most of his
masterpieces having been created during the turbulent
years of his wanderings. In 1835 he had been married
to Virginia Clemm, his cousin, and her early death in
1847 broke his spirit. His health had already succumbed
to his morbid temperament&mdash;which magnified every sorrow
of his chaotic career&mdash;and to the excesses of drugs
and drink. He died most unhappily, October 7, 1849, at
the age of forty&mdash;a master spirit pitifully wrecked before
his prime.</p>

<p>Poe was a remarkable poet, essayist, critic, and short-story
writer. “The Raven,” “Lenore,” “Ulalume,”
“The Bells,” “Annabel Lee,” “Israfel,” and “To One
in Paradise” are among his best poems. Probably the
greatest of his stories are, “MS. Found in A Bottle,”
“The Assignation,” “Ligeia,” “The Murders in The
Rue Morgue,” “The Mystery of Marie Rogêt,” “A
Descent into The Maelstrom,” “The Masque of The Red
Death,” “The Pit and the Pendulum,” “The Gold Bug,”
“The Black Cat,” “The Cask of Amontillado,” “The
Fall of the House of Usher,” first published in <em>Burton’s
Gentleman’s Magazine</em>, September, 1839&mdash;and “The
Purloined Letter,” first published in <em>The Gift</em>, an “annual,”
in 1845.</p>

<p>Poe was the greatest conscious artist that American
literature has ever known. He not only looked backward
upon his own work and, as did Stevenson, clearly traced
the operations of his mind in its production, but he built
up a structure of literary theory which has been powerfully
attacked, indeed, but whose walls remain substantially
whole to-day. To his constructive criticism of
the short-story is directly due its present advanced form,
for while current practice has widely departed from Poe’s
morbid, gloomy, extravagant themes and formal, abundant
diction, his stories are still unsurpassed for vigor,
atmosphere, invention, and thrill, and his laws of composition
are read everywhere with the respect due
authority.</p>

<p class="p1">There are literary evolutionists who, in their whim of seeing
in every original writer a copy of some predecessor, have declared
that Hawthorne is derived from Tieck, and Poe from Hoffmann....
If the adjective American has any meaning at all, it qualifies
Poe and Hawthorne. They were American to the core.
They both revealed the curious sympathy with Oriental moods
of thought which is often an American characteristic. Poe, with
his cold logic and his mathematical analysis, and Hawthorne,
with his introspective conscience and his love of the subtle and
the invisible, are representative of phases of American character
not to be mistaken by any one who has given thought to the
influence of nationality.... Nothing better of its kind has ever
been done than the “Pit and the Pendulum,” or than the “Fall
of the House of Usher” (which has been compared aptly with
Browning’s “Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came” for its
power of suggesting intellectual desolation). Nothing better of
its kind has ever been done than the “Gold Bug,” or than the
“Purloined Letter,” or than the “Murders in the Rue Morgue.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Brander
Matthews</span>, <em>The Philosophy of the Short-story</em>.</p>


<p class="p1">The conception of gloomy terror which impregnates “The
House of Usher” is as complete as the idea of medieval chivalry
underlying <em>Ivanhoe</em>.... To be sure, the terror in his
stories, so he said in his preface to the <em>Tales of the Grotesque
and the Arabesque</em>, was “not of Germany, but of the soul....”
Yet one can readily believe that his Roderick in “The House
of Usher,” who pored over books which had the “character of
phantasm,” Morella, who was interested in the transcendentalism
of Schelling and Fichte, Ægæus, whom “the realities of the
world affected&mdash;as visions,” are all identical with the Young
Poe when he freed his mind and later his fancy in the fields
where Novalis sought the blue flower and all the German romanticists
wandered.... To say that Poe was a creature of
German influence would be absurd. To say that German thought
and fancy were sympathetic to his genius, would be putting it
too mildly. Between these extremes the truth must lie.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. S.

<p class="p1">At Paris, just after dark one gusty
evening in the autumn of 18&mdash;, I was
enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation
and a meerschaum, in company
with my friend C. Auguste Dupin,<span class="sidenote">Dupin appears as the detective
in Poe’s other mystery
stories, “The Murders
in the Rue Morgue,”
and “The Mystery of
Marie Rogêt.”<br />
<em>Au troisième</em>&mdash;third flight,
or fourth floor.</span>
in his little back library, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
book closet, <em>au troisième, No. 33
Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St. Germain</em>.
For one hour at least we had maintained
a profound silence; while each,
to any casual observer, might have
seemed intently and exclusively occupied
with the curling eddies of
smoke that oppressed the atmosphere
of the chamber. <span class="sidenote">Compare this story with
Sardou’s “A Scrap of
Paper.”</span>For myself, however,
I was mentally discussing certain
topics which had formed matter
for conversation between us at an
earlier period of the evening; I mean
the affair of the Rue Morgue, and
the mystery attending the murder of
Marie Rogêt. I looked upon it,
therefore, as something of a coincidence,<span class="sidenote">G&mdash;&mdash; also appears in “The
Mystery of Marie Rogêt.”</span>
when the door of our apartment
was thrown open and admitted
our old acquaintance, Monsieur
G&mdash;&mdash;, the Prefect of the Parisian
police.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Careless English.</div>

<p>2. We gave him a hearty welcome;
for there was nearly half as much of
the entertaining as of the contemptible
about the man, and we had not
seen him for several years. We had
been sitting in the dark, and Dupin
now arose for the purpose of lighting
a lamp, but sat down again,
without doing so, upon G&mdash;&mdash;'s saying
that he had called to consult us,
or rather to ask the opinion of my
friend, about some official business
which had occasioned a great deal
of trouble.</p>

<p>3. “If it is any point requiring reflection,”
observed Dupin, as he forbore
to enkindle the wick, “we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
examine it to better purpose in the
dark.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Later writers of detective
stories follow Poe’s lead

police officials.</div>

<p>4. “That is another of your odd
notions,” said the Prefect, who had
a fashion of calling everything
“odd” that was beyond his comprehension,
and thus lived amid an
absolute legion of “oddities.”</p>

<p>5. “Very true,” said Dupin, as he
supplied his visitor with a pipe, and
rolled towards him a comfortable
chair.</p>

<p>6. “And what is the difficulty
now?” I asked. “Nothing more in
the assassination way, I hope?”</p>

<p>7. “Oh, no; nothing of that nature.
The fact is, the business is <em>very</em>
simple, indeed, and I make no doubt
that we can manage it sufficiently well
ourselves; but then I thought Dupin
would like to hear the details of it,
because it is so excessively <em>odd</em>.”</p>

<p>8. “Simple and odd,” said Dupin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poe makes G&mdash;&mdash; to serve
as a foil for Dupin, while
the narrator plays Watson
to Dupin’s Sherlock&mdash;but
Poe came first!</div>

<p>9. “Why, yes; and not exactly
that, either. The fact is, we have all
been a good deal puzzled because the
affair is so simple, and yet baffles us
altogether.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forecast of denouement.
Note how this point is
emphasized.</div>

<p id="par10">10. “Perhaps it is the very simplicity
of the thing which puts you at
fault,” said my friend.</p>

<p>11. “What nonsense you <em>do</em> talk!”
replied the Prefect, laughing heartily.</p>

<p>12. “Perhaps the mystery is a little
<em>too</em> plain,” said Dupin.</p>

<p>13. “Oh, good Heavens! who ever
heard of such an idea?”</p>

<p>14. “A little <em>too</em> self-evident.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Later imitators freely use
this scheme of the superior
pose of the police.</div>

<p>15. “Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ho!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
ho! ho!” roared our visitor, profoundly
amused. “Oh, Dupin, you
will be the death of me yet!”</p>

<p>16. “And what, after all, is the
matter on hand?” I asked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This device has since been
much overworked.</div>

<p>17. “Why, I will tell you,” replied
the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady,
and contemplative puff, and settled
himself in his chair. “I will tell you
in a few words; but, before I begin,
let me caution you that this is an affair
demanding the greatest secrecy,
and that I should most probably lose
the position I now hold were it
known that I confided it to any one.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Lengthy Introduction

Note that this is one unified
story, with much philosophising,
but no minor episodes.</div>

<p>18. “Proceed,” said I.</p>

<p>19. “Or not,” said Dupin.</p>


<p>20. “Well, then; I have received
personal information from a very
high quarter that a certain document
of the last importance has been purloined
from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is
known; this beyond a doubt; <span class="sidenote">The foundation laid; <span class="allsmcap">SUMMARY
OF PROBLEM</span>.</span> he was
seen to take it. It is known, also,
that it still remains in his possession.”</p>

<p>21. “How is this known?” asked
Dupin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Development of problem.</div>

<p>22. “It is clearly inferred,” replied
the Prefect, “from the nature of the
document, and from the non-appearance
of certain results which would
at once arise from its passing out of
the robber’s possession; that is to say,
from his employing it as he must design
in the end to employ it.”</p>

<p>23. “Be a little more explicit,” I
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>24. “Well, I may venture so far as
to say that the paper gives its holder
a certain power in a certain quarter
where such power is immensely valuable.”
The Prefect was fond of the
cant of diplomacy.</p>

<p>25. “Still I do not quite understand,”
said Dupin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance of problem.</div>

<p>26. “No? well; the disclosure of
the document to a third person, who
shall be nameless, would bring in
question the honor of a personage
of most exalted station; and this fact
gives the holder of the document an
ascendency over the illustrious personage
whose honor and peace are so
jeopardized.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Philosophy of problem.</div>

<p>27. “But this ascendency,” I interposed,
“would depend upon the robber’s
knowledge of the loser’s knowledge
of the robber. Who would
dare&mdash;”</p>


<p>28. “The thief,” said G&mdash;&mdash;, “is
the Minister D&mdash;&mdash;, who dares all
things, those unbecoming as well as
those becoming a man. <span class="sidenote">Unique situation: the thief
is known.</span>The method
of the theft was not less ingenious
than bold. The document in question&mdash;a
letter, to be frank&mdash;had been
received by the personage robbed
while alone in the royal <em>boudoir</em>.
During its perusal she was suddenly
interrupted by the entrance of the
other exalted personage, from whom
especially it was her wish to conceal
it. <span class="sidenote">Method and circumstances
of the theft related.</span> After a hurried and vain endeavor
to thrust it in a drawer, she was
forced to place it, open as it was, upon
a table. The address, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
was uppermost, and, the contents thus
unexposed, the letter escaped notice.<span class="sidenote">See note on <a href="#par115">¶115</a>, p. 104.</span>
At this juncture enters the Minister
D&mdash;&mdash;. His lynx eye immediately
perceives the paper, recognizes the
handwriting of the address, observes
the confusion of the personage addressed,
and fathoms her secret. After
some business transactions, hurried
through in his ordinary manner,
he produces a letter somewhat similar
to the one in question, opens it, pretends
to read it, and then places it
in close juxtaposition to the other.
Again he converses for some fifteen
minutes upon the public affairs.<span class="sidenote">Note “the”.</span> At
length in taking leave he takes also
from the table the letter to which he
had no claim. Its rightful owner
saw, but of course dared not call attention
to the act, in the presence of
the third personage, who stood at
her elbow. The minister decamped,
leaving his own letter&mdash;one of no
importance&mdash;upon the table.”</p>

<p>29. “Here, then,” said Dupin to me,
“you have precisely what you demand
to make the ascendency complete&mdash;the
robber’s knowledge of the loser’s
knowledge of the robber.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Results of theft.</div>


<p>30. “Yes,” replied the Prefect;
“and the power thus attained has, for
some months past, been wielded, for
political purposes, to a very dangerous
extent. The personage robbed is
more thoroughly convinced, every
day, of the necessity of reclaiming her
letter. <span class="sidenote">End of statement of case as
a problem.</span>But this, of course, cannot be
done openly. In fine, driven to despair,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
she has committed the matter to
me.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character development.<br />
Satire supports his attitude
toward the police.</div>

<p>31. “Than whom,” said Dupin,
amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke,
“no more sagacious agent could, I
suppose, be desired, or even imagined.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character delineation.</div>

<p>32. “You flatter me,” replied the
Prefect; “but it is possible that some
such opinion may have been entertained.”</p>

<p>33. “It is clear,” said I, “as you observe,
that the letter is still in possession
of the minister; since it is this
possession, and not any employment
of the letter, which bestows the power.
With the employment the power
departs.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Attempts at recovery of
the purloined letter.
Second stage of the
plot.</span></div>

<p>34. “True,” said G&mdash;&mdash;, “and upon
this conviction I proceeded. My
first care was to make thorough
search of the minister’s hotel; and
here my chief embarrassment lay in
the necessity of searching without his
knowledge. Beyond all things, I
have been warned of the danger
which would result from giving him
reason to suspect our design.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Au fait</em>&mdash;to the point;
therefore, at home.</div>

<p>35. “But,” said I, “you are quite
<em>au fait</em> in these investigations. The
Parisian police have done this thing
often before.”</p>

<p>36. “Oh, yes; and for this reason
I did not despair. The habits of the
minister gave me, too, a great advantage.
He is frequently absent
from home all night. His servants
are by no means numerous. They
sleep at a distance from their master’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
apartment, and being chiefly Neapolitans,
are readily made drunk. I
have keys, as you know, with which
I can open any chamber or cabinet in
Paris. For three months, a night has
not passed during the greater part
of which I have not been engaged,
personally, in ransacking the D&mdash;&mdash;
Hotel. My honor is interested, and,
to mention a great secret, the reward
is enormous. So I did not abandon
the search until I had become fully
satisfied that the thief is a more astute
man than myself. I fancy that
I have investigated every nook and
corner of the premises in which it is
possible that the paper can be concealed.”</p>

<p>37. “But is it not possible,” I suggested,
“that although the letter may
be in possession of the minister, as it
unquestionably is, he may have concealed
it elsewhere than upon his own
premises?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inferential reasoning.</div>

<p>38. “This is barely possible,” said
Dupin. “The present peculiar condition
of affairs at court, and especially
of those intrigues in which D&mdash;&mdash; is
known to be involved, would render
the instant availability of the document&mdash;its
susceptibility of being produced
at a moment’s notice&mdash;a point
of nearly equal importance with its
possession.”</p>

<p>39. “Its susceptibility of being produced?”
said I.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the distinction.</div>

<p>40. “That is to say, of being <em>destroyed</em>,”
said Dupin.</p>



<p>41. “True,” I observed; “the paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
is clearly then upon the premises. As
for its being upon the person of the<span class="sidenote">A just inference.</span>
minister, we may consider that as out
of the question.”</p>

<p>42. “Entirely,” said the Prefect.
“He has been twice waylaid, as if
by footpads, and his person rigorously
searched under my own inspection.”</p>

<p>43. “You might have spared yourself
this trouble,” said Dupin.
“D&mdash;&mdash;, I presume, is not altogether
a fool, and, if not, must have anticipated
these waylayings as a matter of
course.”</p>

<p>44. “Not <em>altogether</em> a fool,” said
G&mdash;&mdash;; “but then he’s a poet, which
I take to be only one remove from a
fool.”</p>

<p>45. “True,” said Dupin, after a
long and thoughtful whiff from his
meerschaum, “although I have been
guilty of certain doggerel myself.”</p>

<p>46. “Suppose you detail,” said I,
“the particulars of your search.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The thoroughness of the
search tends to interest
the reader in the problem
as a difficult one.</div>


<p>47. “Why, the fact is, we took our
time, and we searched <em>everywhere</em>. I
have had long experience in these affairs.
I took the entire building,
room by room, devoting the nights of
a whole week to each. We examined,
first, the furniture of each apartment.
We opened every possible drawer;
and I presume you know that, to a
properly trained police agent, such a
thing as a <em>secret</em> drawer is impossible. <span class="sidenote">On Poe’s “police methods”
most modern detective
writers have drawn for
material.</span>
Any man is a dolt who permits a
‘secret’ drawer to escape him in a
search of this kind. The thing is <em>so</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
plain. There is a certain amount of
bulk&mdash;of space&mdash;to be accounted for
in every cabinet. Then we have accurate
rules. The fiftieth part of a
line could not escape us. After the
cabinets we took the chairs. The
cushions we probed with the fine long
needles you have seen me employ.
From the tables we removed the
tops.”</p>

<p>48. “Why so?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doubtless the narrator
speaks.</div>

<p>49. “Sometimes the top of a table,
or other similarly arranged piece of
furniture, is removed by the person
wishing to conceal an article; then
the leg is excavated, the article deposited
within the cavity, and the top
replaced. The bottoms and tops of
bed-posts are employed in the same
way.”</p>

<p>50. “But could not the cavity be
detected by sounding?” I asked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note improper shifting of
tenses in question and
answer.</div>

<p>51. “By no means, if, when the
article is deposited, a sufficient wadding
of cotton be placed around it.
Besides, in our case we were obliged
to proceed without noise.”</p>

<p>52. “But you could not have removed&mdash;you
could not have taken
to pieces <em>all</em> articles of furniture in
which it would have been possible to
make a deposit in the manner you
mention. A letter may be compressed
into a thin spiral roll, not differing
much in shape or bulk from a
large knitting-needle, and in this
form it might be inserted into the
rung of a chair, for example. You
did not take to pieces all the chairs?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Note how ingeniously Poe
weaves his knowledge of
detective methods into the
actual search of the story.</div>

<p>53. “Certainly not; but we did better&mdash;we
examined the rungs of every
chair in the hotel, and indeed, the
jointings of every description of
furniture, by the aid of a most powerful
microscope. Had there been any
traces of recent disturbance we should
not have failed to detect it instantly.
A single grain of gimlet-dust, for example,
would have been as obvious as
an apple. Any disorder in the gluing&mdash;any
unusual gaping in the joints&mdash;would
have sufficed to insure detection.”</p>

<p>54. “I presume you looked to the
mirrors, between the boards and the
plates, and you probed the beds and
the bed-clothes, as well as the curtains
and carpets?”</p>

<p>55. “That, of course; and when we
had absolutely completed every particle
of the furniture in this way, then
we examined the house itself. We
divided its entire surface into compartments,
which we numbered, so
that none might be missed; then we
scrutinized each individual square
inch throughout the premises including
the two houses immediately adjoining,
with the microscope, as before.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">This seems to be a break in
the chain of probability,
as G&mdash;&mdash; has already carefully
explained how he
was able to go over
D&mdash;&mdash;'s house with impunity.</div>

<p>56. “The two houses adjoining!”
I exclaimed; “you must have had a
great deal of trouble.”</p>

<p>57. “We had; but the reward offered
is prodigious.”</p>

<p>58. “You include the <em>grounds</em> about
the houses?”</p>

<p>59. “All the grounds are paved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
with brick. They gave us comparatively
little trouble. We examined
the moss between the bricks, and
found it undisturbed.”</p>

<p>60. “You looked among D&mdash;&mdash;'s
papers, of course, and into the books
of the library?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note unusual word.</div>

<p>61. “Certainly; we opened every
package and parcel; we not only opened
every book, but we turned over
every leaf in each volume, not contenting
ourselves with a mere shake,
according to the fashion of some of
our police officers. We also measured
the thickness of every book-<em>cover</em>,
with the most accurate admeasurement,
and applied to each the most
jealous scrutiny of the microscope.
Had any of the bindings been recently
meddled with, it would have been
utterly impossible that the fact should
have escaped observation. Some five
or six volumes, just from the hands
of the binder, we carefully probed,
longitudinally, with the needles.”</p>

<p>62. “You explored the floors beneath
the carpets?”</p>

<p>63. “Beyond doubt. We removed
every carpet, and examined the boards
with the microscope.”</p>

<p>64. “And the paper on the walls?”</p>

<p>65. “Yes.”</p>

<p>66. “You looked into the cellars?”</p>

<p>67. “We did.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dupin would not have said this.</div>

<p>68. “Then,” I said, “you have been
making a miscalculation, and the letter
is <em>not</em> on the premises, as you suppose.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Deduction Rejected.</span></div>

<p>69. “I fear you are right there,”
said the Prefect. “And now, Dupin,
what would you advise me to do?”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Third Stage of Plot.</span></div>

<p>70 “To make a thorough research
of the premises.”</p>

<p>71. “That is absolutely needless,”
replied G&mdash;&mdash;. “I am not more sure
that I breathe than I am that the letter
is not at the Hotel.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparation for denouement.</div>

<p>72. “I have no better advice to
give you,” said Dupin. “You have,
of course, an accurate description of
the letter?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt to mislead reader.</div>

<p>73. “Oh, yes.” And here the Prefect,
producing a memorandum-book,
proceeded to read aloud a minute account
of the internal, and especially of
the external, appearance of the missing
document. Soon after finishing<span class="sidenote">Note the patronizing “good
gentleman.”</span>
the perusal of this description, he
took his departure, more entirely depressed
in spirits than I had ever
known the good gentleman before.</p>


<p>74. In about a month afterwards
he paid us another visit, and found
us occupied very nearly as before.
He took a pipe and a chair, and entered
into some ordinary conversation.
At length I said:</p>

<p>75. “Well, but G&mdash;&mdash;, what of the
purloined letter? I presume you
have at last made up your mind that
there is no such thing as overreaching
the minister?”</p>

<p>76. “Confound him, say I&mdash;yes; I
made the reëxamination, however, as
Dupin suggested&mdash;but it was all
labor lost, as I knew it would be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>77. “How much was the reward offered,
did you say?” asked Dupin.</p>

<p>78. “Why, a very great deal&mdash;a
<em>very</em> liberal reward&mdash;I don’t like to
say how much precisely; but one
thing I <em>will</em> say, that I wouldn’t mind
giving my individual check for fifty
thousand francs to any one who
would obtain me that letter. The
fact is, it is becoming of more and
more importance every day; and the
reward has been lately doubled. If
it were trebled, however, I could do
no more than I have done.”</p>

<p>79. “Why, yes,” said Dupin drawlingly,
between the whiffs of his meerschaum,
“I really&mdash;think, G&mdash;&mdash;,
you have not exerted yourself&mdash;to
the utmost in this matter. You
might&mdash;do a little more, I think,
eh?”</p>

<p>80. “How?&mdash;in what way?”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Fourth Stage of Plot.</span><br />
Illustrative anecdote of Dr.
John Abernethy, the English
surgeon.</div>

<p>81. “Why [puff, puff], you might
[puff, puff] employ counsel in the
matter, eh? [puff, puff, puff] Do
you remember the story they tell of
Abernethy?”</p>

<p>82. “No; hang Abernethy!”</p>

<p>83. “To be sure! hang him and
welcome. But once upon a time, a
certain rich miser conceived the design
of sponging upon this Abernethy
for a medical opinion. Getting up,
for this purpose, an ordinary conversation
in a private company, he insinuated
his case to the physician as
that of an imaginary individual.”</p>

<p>84. “‘We will suppose,’ said the
miser, ‘that his symptoms are such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
and such; now, doctor, what would
<em>you</em> have directed him to take?’”</p>

<p>85. “‘Take!’ said Abernethy,
‘why, take <em>advice</em>, to be sure.’”</p>

<p>86. “But,” said the Prefect, a little
discomposed, “I am <em>perfectly</em> willing
to take advice, and to pay for it.
I would <em>really</em> give fifty thousand
francs to any one who would aid me
in the matter.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Minor Climax.</span></div>

<p>87. “In that case,” replied Dupin,
opening a drawer, and producing a
check-book, “you may as well fill
me up a check for the amount mentioned.
When you have signed it, I
will hand you the letter.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character delineation.</div>

<p>88. I was astounded. The Prefect
appeared absolutely thunderstricken.
For some minutes he remained
speechless and motionless, looking
incredulously at my friend with open
mouth, and eyes that seemed starting
from their sockets; then, apparently
recovering himself in some
measure, he seized a pen, and after
several pauses and vacant stares,
finally filled up and signed a check
for fifty thousand francs, and handed
it across the table to Dupin. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Climax.</span></span>
The latter examined it carefully and
deposited it in his pocket; then, unlocking
an <em>escritoire</em>, took thence a
letter and gave it to the Prefect.<span class="sidenote">The plot <em>seems</em> to end here,
for long reasoning and
explanation follow. There
is, however, a second climax
as Dupin’s story
reaches its denouement.</span>
This functionary grasped it in a perfect
agony of joy, opened it with a
trembling hand, cast a rapid glance
at its contents, and then, scrambling
and struggling to the door, rushed at
length unceremoniously from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
room and from the house, without
having uttered a syllable since Dupin
had requested him to fill up the
check.</p>

<p>89. When he had gone, my friend
entered into some explanations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Stage of Dupin’s
Account.</span> This account
places Dupin’s methods in
artistic contrast with those
of the Prefect.</div>

<p>90. “The Parisian police,” he said,
“are exceedingly able in their way.
They are persevering, ingenious, cunning,
and thoroughly versed in the
knowledge which their duties seem
chiefly to demand. Thus, when
G&mdash;&mdash; detailed to us his mode of
searching the premises at the Hotel
D&mdash;&mdash;, I felt entire confidence in his
having made a satisfactory investigation&mdash;so
far as his labors extended.”</p>

<p>91. “So far as his labors extended?”
said I.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Not a precise statement.</div>

<p>92. “Yes,” said Dupin. “The
measures adopted were not only the
best of their kind, but carried out to
absolute perfection. Had the letter
been deposited within the range of
their search, these fellows would, beyond
a question, have found it.”</p>

<p>93. I merely laughed, but he
seemed quite serious in all that he
said.</p>


<p id="par94">94. “The measures, then,” he continued,
“were good in their kind, and
well executed; their defect lay in
their being inapplicable to the case,
and to the man. A certain set of
highly ingenious resources are, with
the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean
bed to which he forcibly adapts his
designs. But he perpetually errs by
being too deep or too shallow for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the matter in hand; and many a
schoolboy is a better reasoner than <span class="sidenote">Illustrative anecdote.</span>
he. I knew one about eight years of
age, whose success at guessing in the
game of ‘even and odd’ attracted
universal admiration. This game is
simple, and is played with marbles.
One player holds in his hand a number
of these toys, and demands of another
whether that number is even or
odd. If the guess is right, the guesser
wins one; if wrong, he loses one.
The boy to whom I allude won all the
marbles of the school. Of course he
had some principle of guessing; and
this lay in mere observation and admeasurement
of the astuteness of his <span class="sidenote">Joint inductive-deductive
method of reasoning.</span>
opponents. For example an arrant
simpleton is his opponent, and, holding
up his closed hand asks, ‘Are they
even or odd?’ Our schoolboy replies,
‘Odd,’ and loses; but upon the
second trial he wins, for he then says
to himself, ‘The simpleton had them
even upon the first trial, and his
amount of cunning is just sufficient to
make him have them odd upon the
second; I will therefore guess odd;’
he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with
a simpleton a degree above the first,
he would have reasoned thus: ‘This
fellow finds that in the first instance<span class="sidenote">Inductive reasoning.</span>
I guessed odd, and in the second he
will propose to himself, upon the first
impulse, a simple variation from even
to odd, as did the first simpleton; but
then a second thought will suggest
that this is too simple a variation,
and finally he will decide upon putting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
it even as before. I will therefore
guess even;’ he guesses even,
and wins. Now this mode of reasoning
in the schoolboy, whom his fellows
term ‘lucky’&mdash;what, in its last
analysis, is it?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reduced to untechnical language.</div>

<p id="par95">95. “It is merely,” I said, “an
identification of the reasoner’s intellect
with that of his opponent.”</p>

<p>96. “It is,” said Dupin; “and, upon
inquiring of the boy by what means
he effected the <em>thorough</em> identification
in which his success consisted, I received
answer as follows: ‘When I
wish to find out how wise, or how
stupid, or how good, or how wicked
is any one, or what are his thoughts
at the moment, I fashion the expression
of my face, as accurately as possible,<span class="sidenote">Compare with Barrie’s statement
on p. <a href="#Page_217">217</a>.</span>
in accordance with the expression
of his, and then wait to see what
thoughts or sentiments arise in my
mind or heart, as if to match or correspond
with the expression.’ This
response of the schoolboy lies at the <span class="sidenote">1 and 2, French authors
and moralists; 3, astute
Italian statesman; 4, Italian
thinker.</span>
bottom of all the spurious profundity
which has been attributed to Rochefoucauld,
to La Bruyère, to Machiavelli,
and to Campanella.”</p>

<p>97. “And the identification,” I
said, “of the reasoner’s intellect
with that of his opponent’s, depends,
if I understand you aright, upon the
accuracy with which the opponent’s
intellect is admeasured.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analysis.<br />
Observe how fond Poe is of
long paragraphs.</div>

<p id="par98">98. “For its practical value it depends
upon this,” replied Dupin,
“and the Prefect and his cohort fail
so frequently, first, by default of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
identification, and secondly, by ill-admeasurement,
or rather through non-admeasurement,
of the intellect with
which they are engaged. They consider
only their <em>own</em> ideas of ingenuity;
and, in searching for anything
hidden, advert only to the modes in
which <em>they</em> would have hidden it.
They are right in this much&mdash;that
their own ingenuity is a faithful representative
of that of <em>the mass</em>; but
when the cunning of the individual
felon is diverse in character from
their own, the felon foils them, of
course. This always happens when
it is above their own, and very usually
when it is below. They have no <span class="sidenote">Astute comment.</span>
variation of principle in their investigations;
at best, when urged by some
unusual emergency, by some extraordinary
reward, they extend or exaggerate
their old modes of <em>practice</em>,
without touching their principles.
What, for example, in this case of
D&mdash;&mdash;, has been done to vary the
principle of action? What is all this <span class="sidenote">Note the length of this
paragraph.</span>
boring, and probing, and sounding,
and scrutinizing with the microscope,
and dividing the surface of the building
into registered square inches&mdash;what
is it all but an exaggeration <em>of
the application</em> of the one principle or
set of principles of search, which are
based upon the one set of notions
regarding human ingenuity, to which
the Prefect, in the long routine of his
duty, has been accustomed? Do you
not see he has taken it for granted
that <em>all</em> men proceed to conceal a letter&mdash;not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
exactly in a gimlet-hole
bored in a chair leg&mdash;but, at least,
in <em>some</em> out of the way hole or <span class="sidenote">A cumbersomely long sentence.</span>
corner suggested by the same tenor
of thought which would urge a
man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole
bored in a chair leg? And
do you not see, also, that such
<em>recherchés</em> nooks for concealment
are adapted only for ordinary occasions
and would be adopted only by<span class="sidenote"><em>Recherchés</em>&mdash;carefully
sought out.</span>
ordinary intellects; for, in all cases
of concealment, a disposal of the article
concealed&mdash;a disposal of it in
this <em>recherché</em> manner&mdash;is, in the
very first instance, presumable and
presumed; and thus its discovery depends,
not at all upon the acumen, but
altogether upon the mere care, patience,
and determination of the seekers;
and where the case is of importance&mdash;or,
what amounts to the
same thing in policial eyes, when
the reward is of magnitude&mdash;the
qualities in question have <em>never</em> been
known to fail. You will now understand
what I meant in suggesting
that, had the purloined letter been
hidden anywhere within the limits of
the Prefect’s examination&mdash;in other
words, had the principle of its concealment <span class="sidenote">Note force of “hidden.”</span>
been comprehended within
the principles of the Prefect, its discovery
would have been a matter altogether
beyond question. This functionary,
however, has been thoroughly
mystified; and the remote source of
his defeat lies in the supposition that
the minister is a fool because he has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
acquired renown as a poet. All fools <span class="sidenote">“The undistributed middle”
is a form of logical
fallacy.</span>
are poets; this the Prefect <em>feels</em>; and
he is merely guilty of a <em>non distributio
medii</em> in thence inferring that all
poets are fools.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the following series of
unusual statements.</div>

<p>99. “But is this really the poet?”
I asked. “There are two brothers, I
know; and both have attained reputation
in letters. The minister, I believe,
has written learnedly on the
Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician
and no poet.”</p>

<p>100. “You are mistaken; I know
him well; he is both. As poet <em>and</em>
mathematician he would reason well;
as mere mathematician he could not
have reasoned at all, and thus would
have been at the mercy of the Prefect.”</p>

<p>101. “You surprise me,” I said,
“by these opinions, which have been
contradicted by the voice of the
world. You do not mean to set at
naught the well-digested idea of
centuries. The mathematical reason
has long been regarded as <em>the</em> reason
<em>par excellence</em>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“It may be said that every
public idea, every received
convention, is a piece of
stupidity, for it has suited
the greater number.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nicolas
Chamfort.</span></div>


<p>102. “‘<em>Il y a à parier</em>,’” replied
Dupin, quoting from Chamfort,
“‘<em>que toute idée publique, toute convention
reçue, est une sottise, car elle
a convenu au plus grand nombre</em>.’
The mathematicians, I grant you,
have done their best to promulgate
the popular error to which you allude,
and which is none the less an
error for its promulgation as truth.
With an art worthy a better cause,
for example, they have insinuated the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
term ‘analysis’ into application to <span class="sidenote">This whole section of the
story triumphs notwithstanding
its undue length
of learned discussion and
its formal diction. It
must be admitted that in
these respects the present-day
short-story is in advance
of Poe. A number
of paragraphs here fail to
advance the narration <em>as
fiction</em>.</span>
algebra. The French are the originators
of this practical deception; but
if a term is of any importance&mdash;if
words derive any value from applicability&mdash;then
‘analysis’ conveys
‘algebra,’ about as much as, in
Latin, ‘<em>ambitus</em>’ implies ‘ambition,’
‘<em>religio</em>,’ ‘religion,’ or ‘<em>homines honesti</em>,’
a set of <em>honorable</em> men.”</p>

<p>103. “You have a quarrel on hand,
I see,” said I, “with some of the
algebraists of Paris; but proceed.”</p>



<p>104. “I dispute the availability, and
thus the value of that reason which
is cultivated in any especial form other
than the abstractly logical. I dispute,
in particular, the reason educed
by mathematical study. <span class="sidenote">Unusual form. Throughout,
note Poe’s unusual choice
of words.</span> The mathematics
are the science of form and
quantity; mathematical reasoning is
merely logic applied to observation
upon form and quantity. The great
error lies in supposing that even the
truths of what is called <em>pure</em> algebra
are abstract or general truths. And
this error is so egregious that I am
confounded at the universality with
which it has been received. Mathematical
axioms are <em>not</em> axioms of
general truth. What is true of <em>relation</em>&mdash;of
form and quantity&mdash;is
often grossly false in regard to
morals, for example. In this latter <span class="sidenote">As a piece of pure reasoning
this long treatise is
not without its defects,
but it does bring out&mdash;though
too laboriously to
please&mdash;the point at
which Dupin is driving.</span>
science it is very usually <em>un</em>true that
the aggregated parts are equal to the
whole. In chemistry, also, the axiom
fails. In the consideration of motive
it fails; for two motives, each of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
given value, have not, necessarily, a
value when united equal to the sum
of their values apart. There are
numerous other mathematical truths
which are only truths within the
limits of <em>relation</em>. But the mathematician
argues, from his <em>finite
truths</em>, through habit, as if they
were of an absolutely general applicability&mdash;as
the world indeed
imagines them to be. <span class="sidenote">Jacob Bryant.</span>Bryant, in his
very learned ‘Mythology,’ mentions
an analogous source of error, when
he says that ‘although the Pagan
fables are not believed, yet we forget
ourselves continually, and make inferences
from them as existing realities.’ <span class="sidenote">He speaks figuratively.</span>
With the algebraists, however,
who are Pagans themselves, the
‘Pagan fables’ <em>are</em> believed and the
inferences are made, not so much
through lapse of memory as through
an unaccountable addling of the
brains. In short, I never yet encountered
the mere mathematician
who could be trusted out of equal
roots, or one who did not clandestinely
hold it as a point of his faith <span class="sidenote">A striking satire.</span>
that <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>px</em> was absolutely and unconditionally
equal to <em>q</em>. Say to one
of these gentlemen, by way of experiment,
if you please, that you believe
occasions may occur where
<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>px</em> is not altogether equal to <em>q</em>, <span class="sidenote">More satire.</span>
and, having made him understand
what you mean, get out of his reach
as speedily as convenient, for beyond
doubt he will endeavor to
knock you down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the force of “last.”</div>


<p>105. “I mean to say,” continued Dupin,
while I merely laughed at his
last observations, “that if the minister
had been no more than a mathematician
the Prefect would have been
under no necessity of giving me this
check. I knew him, however, as both
mathematician and poet, and my
measures were adapted to his capacity
with reference to the circumstances
by which he was surrounded. <span class="sidenote">A return from the special
argument to the practical. <br />
Application of the foregoing
principles.</span>
I knew him as courtier, too, and as
a bold <em>intriguant</em>. Such a man, I
considered, could not fail to be aware
of the ordinary policial modes of
action. He could not have failed to
anticipate&mdash;and events have proved
that he did not fail to anticipate&mdash;the
waylayings to which he was subjected.
He must have foreseen, I
reflected, the secret investigations of
his premises. <span class="sidenote">A difficult point explained.</span> His frequent absences
from home at night, which were hailed
by the Prefect as certain aids to his
success, I regarded only as ruses, to
afford opportunity for thorough
search to the police, and thus the
sooner to impress them with the
conviction to which G&mdash;&mdash;, in fact, <span class="sidenote">Note the unusual use of
“to,” instead of “at.”</span>
did finally arrive&mdash;the conviction
that the letter was not upon the
premises. I felt, also, that the whole
train of thought, which I was at some
pains in detailing to you just now,
concerning the invariable principle of
policial action in searches for articles
concealed&mdash;I felt that this whole <span class="sidenote">Is this probable?</span>
train of thought would necessarily
pass through the mind of the minister.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
It would imperatively lead him
to despise all the ordinary <em>nooks</em> of
concealment. <span class="sidenote">Compare <a href="#par95">¶95</a>.</span><em>He</em> could not, I reflected,
be so weak as not to see that
the most intricate and remote recess
of his hotel would be as open as his
commonest closets to the eyes, to the
probes, to the gimlets, and to the
microscopes of the Prefect. I saw,
in fine, that he would be driven, as a
matter of course, to <em>simplicity</em>, if not
deliberately induced to it as a matter
of choice. You will remember,
perhaps, how desperately the Prefect
laughed when I suggested, upon our <span class="sidenote">Key. Compare <a href="#par10">¶10</a>.</span>
first interview, that it was just possible
this mystery troubled him so
much on account of its being so
<em>very</em> self-evident.”</p>

<p>106. “Yes,” said I, “I remember
his merriment well. I really thought
he would have fallen into convulsions.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A return to philosophising.</div>


<p>107. “The material world,” continued
Dupin, “abounds with very
strict analogies to the immaterial;
and thus some color of truth has
been given to the rhetorical dogma,
that metaphor, or simile, may be
made to strengthen an argument, as
well as to embellish a description.
The principle of the <em>vis inertiæ</em>, <span class="sidenote">Force of inertia.</span> for
example, seems to be identical in
physics and metaphysics. It is not
more true in the former, that a large
body is with more difficulty set in
motion than a smaller one, and that its
subsequent momentum is commensurate
with this difficulty, than it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
is, in the latter, that intellects of the
vaster capacity, while more forcible,
more constant, and more eventful in
their movements than those of inferior
grade, are yet the less readily
moved, and more embarrassed and
full of hesitation in the first few steps
of their progress. <span class="sidenote">This inquiry is the heart of
the inference.</span> Again: have you
ever noticed which of the street signs
over the shop doors are the most
attractive of attention?”</p>

<p>108. “I have never given the matter
a thought,” I said.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illustrative example.</div>

<p>109. “There is a game of puzzles,”
he resumed, “which is played upon a
map. One party playing requires another
to find a given word&mdash;the
name of town, river, state, or empire&mdash;any
word, in short, upon the motley
and perplexed surface of the
chart. <span class="sidenote">Note the diction.</span> A novice in the game generally
seeks to embarrass his opponents
by giving them the most minutely
lettered names; but the adept selects
such words as stretch in large characters
from one end of the chart to
the other. These, like the over-largely
lettered signs and placards of
the street, escape observation by dint
of being excessively obvious; and
here the physical oversight is precisely
analogous with the moral inapprehension
by which the intellect suffers
to pass unnoticed those considerations
which are too obtrusively
and too palpably self-evident. But <span class="sidenote">Compare <a href="#par94">¶94</a> and <a href="#par98">¶98</a>.</span>
this is a point, it appears, somewhat
above or beneath the understanding
of the Prefect. He never once
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
thought it probable, or possible, that <span class="sidenote">Summary of ”accusation”
against the Prefect’s sagacity.</span>
the minister had deposited the letter
immediately beneath the nose of the
whole world, by way of best preventing
any portion of that world from
perceiving it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the alliteration.</div>

<p>110. “But the more I reflected upon
the daring, dashing, and discriminating
ingenuity of D&mdash;&mdash;; upon
the fact that the document must always
have been <em>at hand</em>, if he intended
to use it to good purpose; and
upon the decisive evidence, obtained
by the Prefect, that it was not hidden
within the limits of that dignitary’s
ordinary search&mdash;the more satisfied <span class="sidenote">Climax of Dupin’s inferential
reasoning.</span>
I became that, to conceal this letter,
the minister had resorted to the comprehensive
and sagacious expedient
of not attempting to conceal it at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Beginning of Real Plot.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Incident of Dupin’s Story.</span><br />
From this point the narration
is free from the
formalities of expression
which mar the central
section of the story.
These, however, were a
characteristic of Poe and
his era.</div>



<p>111. “Full of these ideas, I prepared
myself with a pair of green
spectacles, and called one fine morning,
quite by accident, at the ministerial
hotel. I found D&mdash;&mdash; at home,
yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as
usual, and pretending to be in the
last extremity of <em>ennui</em>. He is, perhaps,
the most really energetic human<span class="sidenote">Note the use of “now.”</span>
being now alive&mdash;but that is only
when nobody sees him.</p>

<p>112. “To be even with him, I complained
of my weak eyes, and lamented
the necessity of the spectacles, under
cover of which I cautiously and
thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment,
while seemingly intent only
upon the conversation of my host.</p>

<p>113. “I paid especial attention to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
a large writing-table near which he
sat, and upon which lay confusedly
some miscellaneous letters and other
papers, with one or two musical instruments
and a few books. Here,
however, after a long and very deliberate
scrutiny, I saw nothing to
excite particular suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dupin’s reasoning sustained.</div>

<p>114. “At length my eyes, in going
the circuit of the room, fell upon a
trumpery filigree card-rack of paste-board,
that hung dangling, by a dirty
blue ribbon, from a little brass knob
just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece.
In this rack, which had three
or four compartments, were five or
six visiting cards and a solitary letter.
This last was much soiled and
crumpled. It was torn nearly in two,
across the middle&mdash;as if a design,
in the first instance, to tear it entirely
up as worthless had been altered, or
stayed, in the second. It had a large
black seal, bearing the D&mdash;&mdash; cipher
<em>very</em> conspicuously, and was addressed,
in a diminutive female hand, to
D&mdash;&mdash;, the minister himself. It was
thrust carelessly, and even, as it seemed,
contemptuously, into one of the
uppermost divisions of the rack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Throughout, Poe used punctuation
more freely than
is now the custom.</div>

<p id="par115">115. “No sooner had I glanced at
this letter than I concluded it to be
that of which I was in search. To
be sure, it was, to all appearance,
radically different from the one of
which the Prefect had read us so
minute a description. Here the seal
was large and black, with the D&mdash;&mdash;
cipher; there it was small and red,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
with the ducal arms of the S&mdash;&mdash;
family. Here the address, to the
minister, was diminutive and feminine;
there, the superscription, to a
certain royal personage, was markedly
bold and decided; the size alone
formed a point of correspondence.<span class="sidenote">It was the custom in earlier
times simply to fold a
letter, seal it with a wafer,
and address it on the back,
which was allowed to remain
otherwise blank.
This accounts for there
being no reference to an
envelope, and also for
the refolding of the letter.</span>
But, then, the <em>radicalness</em> of these
differences, which was excessive; the
dirt, the soiled and torn condition of
the paper, so inconsistent with the
<em>true</em> methodical habits of D&mdash;&mdash;, and
so suggestive of a design to delude
the beholder into an idea of the
worthlessness of the document; these
things, together with the hyper-obtrusive
situation of this document, full
in the view of every visitor, and thus
exactly in accordance with the conclusions
to which I had previously
arrived; these things, I say, were
strongly corroborative of suspicion,
in one who came with the intention
to suspect.</p>


<p>116. “I protracted my visit as long
as possible, and while I maintained
a most animated discussion with the
minister, upon a topic which I knew
well had never failed to interest and
excite him, I kept my attention really
riveted upon the letter. In this
examination, I committed to memory
its external appearance and arrangement
in the rack; and also fell,
at length, upon a discovery which set
at rest whatever trivial doubt I might
have entertained. <span class="sidenote">Note use of “fold” and its
derivatives.</span> In scrutinizing the
edges of the paper, I observed them
to be more <em>chafed</em> than seemed necessary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
They presented the <em>broken</em>
appearance which is manifested when
a stiff paper, having been once folded
and pressed with a folder, is refolded
in a reversed direction, in the same
creases or edges which had formed
the original fold. This discovery
was sufficient. It was clear to me
that the letter had been turned, as a
glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed.<span class="sidenote">A good device.</span>
I bade the minister good-morning,
and took my departure at
once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon
the table.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Apparent Full Climax.</span></div>

<p>117. “The next morning I called
for the snuff-box, when we resumed,
quite eagerly, the conversation of the
preceding day. While thus engaged,
however, a loud report, as if of a
pistol, was heard immediately beneath
the windows of the hotel, and
was succeeded by a series of fearful
screams, and the shoutings of a mob.
D&mdash;&mdash; rushed to a casement, threw
it open, and looked out. In the
meantime, I stepped to the card-rack,
took the letter, put it in my pocket,
and replaced it by a <em>facsimile</em> (so far
as regards externals) which I had
carefully prepared at my lodgings&mdash;imitating
the D&mdash;&mdash; cipher very
readily by means of a seal formed of
bread.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concluding explanations.</div>


<p>118. “The disturbance in the street
had been occasioned by the frantic
behavior of a man with a musket.
He had fired it among a crowd of
women and children. It proved,
however, to have been without ball,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
and the fellow was suffered to go his
way as a lunatic or a drunkard.<span class="sidenote">Note how the climax of
Dupin’s story also serves
as the climax of the Prefect’s
earlier statement of
the problem and his efforts
to solve it.</span>
When he had gone, D&mdash;&mdash; came from
the window, whither I had followed
him immediately upon securing the
object in view. Soon afterwards I
bade him farewell. The pretended
lunatic was a man in my own pay.”</p>

<p>119. “But what purpose had you,”
I asked, “in replacing the letter by a
<em>facsimile</em>? Would it not have been
better, at the first visit, to have seized
it openly and departed?”</p>


<div class="sidenote">In the interest in Dupin’s
reasoning and its results
we have lost sight of the
real importance of the
letter.</div>

<p>120. “D&mdash;&mdash;,” replied Dupin, “is a
desperate man, and a man of nerve.
His hotel, too, is not without attendants
devoted to his interest. Had I
made the wild attempt you suggest I
might never have left the ministerial
presence alive. The good people of
Paris might have heard of me no
more. But I had an object apart
from these considerations. You
know my political prepossessions.
In this matter I act as a partisan of
the lady concerned. For eighteen
months the minister has had her in
his power. She has now him in hers&mdash;since,
being unaware that the letter
is not in his possession, he will
proceed with his exactions as if it
was.<span class="sidenote">Is “was” correct?</span> Thus will he inevitably commit
himself at once to his political
destruction. His downfall, too, will
not be more precipitate than awkward. <span class="sidenote">The descent to Avernus (the fabled
entrance to the
Infernal Regions) is easy.</span>
It is all very well to talk
about the <em>facilis descensus Averni</em>;
but in all kinds of climbing, as
Catalani said of singing, it is far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
more easy to get up than to come
down. In the present instance I
have no sympathy&mdash;at least no pity&mdash;for
him who descends. He is that
<em>monstrum horrendum</em>, an unprincipled
man of genius. I confess, <span class="sidenote">Monster to be shuddered at.</span>
however, that I should like very well
to know the precise character of his
thoughts, when, being defied by her
whom the Prefect terms ‘a certain
personage,’ he is reduced to opening
the letter which I left for him in the
card-rack.”</p>

<p>121. “How? Did you put anything
particular in it?”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Real Climax.</span></div>

<p>122. “Why, it did not seem altogether
right to leave the interior
blank&mdash;that would have been insulting.
D&mdash;&mdash;, at Vienna, once did
me an evil turn, which I told him,
quite good-humoredly, I should remember.
So, as I knew he would
feel some curiosity in regard to the
identity of the person who had outwitted
him, I thought it a pity not
to give him a clew. He is well acquainted
with my MS., and I just
copied into the middle of the blank
sheet the words:&mdash;</p>

<h3>JACOBS AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>William Wymark Jacobs was born in London, September
8, 1863, the son of William Gage Jacobs. He
was educated at private schools, and entered the employ
of the Post Office Savings Bank at sixteen. Four years
later he secured a regular clerkship there. He began his
literary career at the age of twenty-one with a contribution
to the <em>Blackfriars Magazine</em>, a publication conducted
by the clerks at the Post Office, and from that he was
led to contributing articles to various London papers,
though he retained his Civil Service position until 1899.
His remarkable acquaintance with nautical subjects, and
characters of the coasting trade and seaport wharves,
was acquired during several years spent in Wapping,
while his father was wharfinger there, as during that
period the younger Jacobs was brought into contact with
many seamen and wharf hands, and came to know many
of them very well. In 1900 he married Agnes Eleanor
Williams. Some of Jacobs’ most popular collections of
stories are <em>Many Cargoes</em>; <em>More Cargoes</em>; <em>Short Cruises</em>;
<em>Odd Craft</em>; <em>Captains All</em>; <em>Light Freights</em>; and <em>The Lady
of the Barge</em>. His longer stories include <em>A Master of
Craft</em>, <em>Dialstone Lane</em>; <em>Salthaven</em>, and <em>At Sunwich Port</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Jacobs is known mostly by his delightfully quaint
and humorous character delineations of river, shore, and
sea-faring folk. The remarkable short-story given herewith,
however, is of a very different sort and discloses a
mastery of the weird, of the supernatural, which is not
surpassed in the whole short-story field. With a sureness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
of character-drawing which is nothing short of amazing
in a humorist, he outlines scene and actors, and when
the crises are reached&mdash;so completely is all visualized&mdash;we
are able to infer the swift-moving climax with scarce
the need of a word. “The Monkey’s Paw” is one of
the most dramatically poignant stories of the supernatural
ever written, and invites us to a closer study of
its gifted and versatile author.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It [a sea-life] is a man’s life. It teaches self-restraint and
discipline and the art of governing men. It is a fine, healthy
life that breeds men. All that I mean to say is that distance
lends enchantment to the view, and that the essential romance
and comedy of the life of those who go down to the sea in
ships are intensified in the perspective of years.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. W. Jacobs</span>,
<em>London Daily Chronicle</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Londoners, in particular, should hail him with applause, for
he has done more than make them laugh; he has added character
to their river. Henceforward no one who has read <em>Many Cargoes</em>
will look at a passing barge with an apathetic gaze. He
will see before him not merely a vehicle of porterage, but a hot-bed
of liquorish and acceptable sarcasm.&mdash;<em>Academy</em> (London).</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Jacobs has two great gifts: one is the power to place a
simple-minded man in a corner, excite our sympathies for him,
magnify his embarrassments, and keep us engrossed all the time....
But we do not consider that herein lies Mr. Jacobs’s special
distinction.... It is in his eye for character, his knowledge of
a certain kind of human nature, his genius for the little touches,
as we prefer to call them, that Mr. Jacobs stands out so notably.
No one now writing can manage the little touches as Mr. Jacobs
can, at once so naturally, so truthfully, so usefully, and so joyously....
None of them actually helps the plot, but every one
of them is so much added to the characters and conditions of
the story.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ibid.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We cannot think of any other books with which to compare
Mr. Jacobs’s, because there are none just like them. To-day a
number of the best and brightest English and American writers
seem to be getting their inspiration from the sea.... Each one
of these has his own particular field, and in presenting the humour
of the sailor’s life and environment no one approaches Mr.
Jacobs.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bookman</span> (New York).</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are acquainted with one pronounced pessimist, who maintains
defiantly and aggressively that he never reads anything in
the nature of modern fiction. “Except, of course,” he adds, “the
short stories of W. W. Jacobs, which certainly make me laugh....”
We are inclined to believe that there are a number of men
who are of the same mind in regard to the work of Mr. Jacobs.
Yet we do not think that his most ardent admirer, after having
laid aside one of his books for three days, would be able to give
more than the vaguest description of the tales contained therein.
To this rule there are, however, several exceptions. “The
Monkey’s Paw,” as grewsome a story as has appeared for years,
was one.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ibid.</span></p>

<h3>THE MONKEY’S PAW<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></h3>

<p class="big05 center">BY W. W. JACOBS</p>


<p class="p2 center">I</p>

<p>Without, the night was cold and
wet, but in the small parlour of
Laburnam Villa the blinds were
drawn and the fire burned brightly.
Father and son were at chess, the
former, who possessed ideas about
the game involving radical changes,
putting his king into such sharp and
unnecessary perils that it even provoked
comment from the white-haired
old lady knitting placidly by the
fire.</p>

<p>2. “Hark at the wind,” said Mr.
White, who having seen a fatal mistake
after it was too late, was amiably
desirous of preventing his son
from seeing it.</p>

<p>3. “I’m listening,” said the latter,
grimly surveying the board as he
stretched out his hand. “Check.”</p>

<p>4. “I should hardly think that he’d
come to-night,” said his father, with
his hand poised over the board.</p>

<p>5. “Mate,” replied the son.</p>

<p>6. “That’s the worst of living so
far out,” bawled Mr. White, with
sudden and unlooked-for violence;
“of all the beastly, slushy, out-of-the-way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
places to live in, this is the
worst. Pathway’s a bog, and the
road’s a torrent. I don’t know what
people are thinking about. I suppose
because only two houses in the
road are let, they think it doesn’t
matter.”</p>


<p>7. “Never mind, dear,” said his
wife, soothingly; “perhaps you’ll
win the next one.”</p>

<p>8. Mr. White looked up sharply,
just in time to intercept a knowing
glance between mother and son.
The words died away on his lips, and
he hid a guilty grin in his thin grey
beard.</p>

<p>9. “There he is,” said Herbert
White, as the gate banged to loudly
and heavy footsteps came toward
the door.</p>

<p>10. The old man rose with hospitable
haste, and opening the door,
was heard condoling with the new
arrival. The new arrival also condoled
with himself, so that Mrs.
White said, “Tut, tut!” and coughed
gently as her husband entered
the room, followed by a tall, burly
man, beady of eye and rubicund of
visage.</p>

<p>11. “Sergeant-Major Morris,” he
said, introducing him.</p>

<p>12. The sergeant-major shook
hands, and taking the proffered seat
by the fire, watched contentedly
while his host got out whiskey and
tumblers and stood a small copper
kettle on the fire.</p>

<p>13. At the third glass his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
got brighter, and he began to talk,
the little family circle regarding with
eager interest this visitor from distant
parts, as he squared his broad
shoulders in the chair and spoke of
wild scenes and doughty deeds; of
wars and plagues and strange peoples.</p>

<p>14. “Twenty-one years of it,” said
Mr. White, nodding at his wife and
son. “When he went away he was
a slip of a youth in the warehouse.
Now look at him.”</p>

<p>15. “He don’t look to have taken
much harm,” said Mrs. White, politely.</p>

<p>16. “I’d like to go to India myself,”
said the old man, “just to look
round a bit, you know.”</p>

<p>17. “Better where you are,” said
the sergeant-major, shaking his head.
He put down the empty glass, and
sighing softly, shook it again.</p>

<p>18. “I should like to see those old
temples and fakirs and jugglers,”
said the old man. “What was that
you started telling me the other day
about a monkey’s paw or something,
Morris?”</p>

<p>19. “Nothing,” said the soldier,
hastily. “Leastways nothing worth
hearing.”</p>

<p>20. “Monkey’s paw?” said Mrs.
White, curiously.</p>

<p>21. “Well, it’s just a bit of what
you might call magic, perhaps,” said
the sergeant-major, offhandedly.</p>

<p>22. His three listeners leaned forward
eagerly. The visitor absentmindedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
put his empty glass to his
lips and then set it down again.
His host filled it for him.</p>

<p>23. “To look at,” said the sergeant-major,
fumbling in his pocket,
“it’s just an ordinary little paw,
dried to a mummy.”</p>

<p>24. He took something out of his
pocket and proffered it. Mrs. White
drew back with a grimace, but her
son, taking it, examined it curiously.</p>

<p>25. “And what is there special
about it?” inquired Mr. White as
he took it from his son, and having
examined it, placed it upon the table.</p>

<p>26. “It had a spell put on it by
an old fakir,” said the sergeant-major,
“a very holy man. He wanted
to show that fate ruled people’s
lives, and that those who interfered
with it did so to their sorrow. He
put a spell on it so that three separate
men could each have three
wishes from it.”</p>

<p>27. His manner was so impressive
that his hearers were conscious that
their light laughter jarred somewhat.</p>

<p>28. “Well, why don’t you have
three, sir?” said Herbert White,
cleverly.</p>

<p>29. The soldier regarded him in
the way that middle age is wont to
regard presumptuous youth. “I
have,” he said, quietly, and his
blotchy face whitened.</p>

<p>30. “And did you really have the
three wishes granted?” asked Mrs.
White.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>31. “I did,” said the sergeant-major,
and his glass tapped against his
strong teeth.</p>

<p>32. “And has anybody else wished?”
persisted the old lady.</p>

<p>33. “The first man had his three
wishes. Yes,” was the reply; “I
don’t know what the first two were,
but the third was for death. That’s
how I got the paw.”</p>

<p>34. His tones were so grave that
a hush fell upon the group.</p>

<p>35. “If you’ve had your three
wishes, it’s no good to you now, then,
Morris,” said the old man at last.
“What do you keep it for?”</p>

<p>36. The soldier shook his head.
“Fancy, I suppose,” he said, slowly.
“I did have some idea of selling it,
but I don’t think I will. It has caused
enough mischief already. Besides,
people won’t buy. They think it’s
a fairy tale, some of them; and those
who do think anything of it want to
try it first and pay me afterward.”</p>

<p>37. “If you could have another
three wishes,” said the old man, eyeing
him keenly, “would you have
them?”</p>

<p>38. “I don’t know,” said the other.
“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>39. He took the paw, and dangling
it between his forefinger and thumb,
suddenly threw it upon the fire.
White, with a slight cry, stooped
down and snatched it off.</p>

<p>40. “Better let it burn,” said the
soldier, solemnly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>41. “If you don’t want it, Morris,”
said the other, “give it to me.”</p>

<p>42. “I won’t,” said his friend doggedly.
“I threw it on the fire. If
you keep it, don’t blame me for what
happens. Pitch it on the fire again
like a sensible man.”</p>

<p>43. The other shook his head and
examined his new possession closely.
“How do you do it?” he inquired.</p>

<p>44. “Hold it up in your right hand
and wish aloud,” said the sergeant-major,
“but I warn you of the consequences.”</p>

<p>45. “Sounds like the Arabian
Nights,” said Mrs. White, as she rose
and began to set the supper. “Don’t
you think you might wish for four
pairs of hands for me?”</p>

<p>46. Her husband drew the talisman
from his pocket, and then all three
burst into laughter as the sergeant-major,
with a look of alarm on his
face, caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>47. “If you must wish,” he said,
gruffly, “wish for something sensible.”</p>

<p>48. Mr. White dropped it back in
his pocket, and placing chairs, motioned
his friend to the table. In the
business of supper the talisman was
partly forgotten, and afterward the
three sat listening in an enthralled
fashion to a second installment of the
soldier’s adventures in India.</p>

<p>49. “If the tale about the monkey’s
paw is not more truthful than those
he has been telling us,” said Herbert,
as the door closed behind their guest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
just in time for him to catch the last
train, “we shan’t make much out of
it.”</p>

<p>50. “Did you give him anything
for it, father?” inquired Mrs. White,
regarding her husband closely.</p>

<p>51. “A trifle,” said he, colouring
slightly. “He didn’t want it, but I
made him take it. And he pressed
me again to throw it away.”</p>

<p>52. “Likely,” said Herbert, with
pretended horror. “Why, we’re going
to be rich, and famous and happy.
Wish to be an emperor, father,
to begin with; then you can’t be hen-pecked.”</p>

<p>53. He darted round the table,
pursued by the maligned Mrs. White
armed with an antimacassar.</p>

<p>54. Mr. White took the paw from
his pocket and eyed it dubiously. “I
don’t know what to wish for, and
that’s a fact,” he said, slowly. “It
seems to me I’ve got all I want.”</p>

<p>55. “If you only cleared the house,
you’d be quite happy, wouldn’t you?”
said Herbert, with his hand on his
shoulder. “Well, wish for two hundred
pounds, then; that’ll just do
it.”</p>

<p>56. His father, smiling shamefacedly
at his own credulity, held up the
talisman, as his son, with a solemn
face, somewhat marred by a wink at
his mother, sat down at the piano
and struck a few impressive chords.</p>

<p>57. “I wish for two hundred
pounds,” said the old man distinctly.</p>

<p>58. A fine crash from the piano<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
greeted the words, interrupted by a
shuddering cry from the old man.
His wife and son ran toward him.</p>

<p>59. “It moved,” he cried, with a
glance of disgust at the object as it
lay on the floor.</p>

<p>60. “As I wished, it twisted in my
hand like a snake.”</p>

<p>61. “Well, I don’t see the money,”
said his son as he picked it up and
placed it on the table, “and I bet
I never shall.”</p>

<p>62. “It must have been your fancy,
father,” said his wife, regarding him
anxiously.</p>

<p>63. He shook his head. “Never
mind, though; there’s no harm, but it
gave me a shock all the same.”</p>

<p>64. They sat down by the fire again
while the two men finished their
pipes. Outside, the wind was higher
than ever, and the old man started
nervously at the sound of a door
banging up-stairs. A silence unusual
and depressing settled upon all three,
which lasted until the old couple rose
to retire for the night.</p>

<p>65. “I expect you’ll find the cash
tied up in a big bag in the middle of
your bed,” said Herbert, as he bade
them good-night, “and something
horrible squatting up on top of the
wardrobe watching you as you pocket
your ill-gotten gains.”</p>

<p>66. He sat alone in the darkness,
gazing at the dying fire, and seeing
faces in it. The last face was so
horrible and so simian that he gazed
at it in amazement. It got so vivid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
that, with a little uneasy laugh, he
felt on the table for a glass containing
a little water to throw over it.
His hand grasped the monkey’s paw,
and with a little shiver he wiped his
hand on his coat and went up to bed.</p>


<p class="p2 center">II</p>

<p>67. In the brightness of the wintry
sun next morning as it streamed over
the breakfast table he laughed at his
fears. There was an air of prosaic
wholesomeness about the room which
it had lacked on the previous night,
and the dirty, shrivelled little paw
was pitched on the sideboard with a
carelessness which betokened no great
belief in its virtues.</p>

<p>68. “I suppose all old soldiers are
the same,” said Mrs. White. “The
idea of our listening to such nonsense!
How could wishes be granted
in these days? And if they could,
how could two hundred pounds hurt
you, father?”</p>

<p>69. “Might drop on his head from
the sky,” said the frivolous Herbert.</p>

<p>70. “Morris said the things happened
so naturally,” said his father,
“that you might if you so wished
attribute it to coincidence.”</p>

<p>71. “Well, don’t break into the
money before I come back,” said Herbert
as he rose from the table. “I’m
afraid it’ll turn you into a mean,
avaricious man, and we shall have
to disown you.”</p>

<p>72. His mother laughed, and following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
him to the door, watched him
down the road; and returning to the
breakfast table, was very happy at the
expense of her husband’s credulity.
All of which did not prevent her from
scurrying to the door at the postman’s
knock, nor prevent her from referring
somewhat shortly to retired sergeant-majors
of bibulous habits when she
found that the post brought a tailor’s
bill.</p>

<p>73. “Herbert will have some more
of his funny remarks, I expect, when
he comes home,” she said, as they
sat at dinner.</p>

<p>74. “I dare say,” said Mr. White,
pouring himself out some beer; “but
for all that, the thing moved in my
hand; that I’ll swear to.”</p>

<p>75. “You thought it did,” said the
old lady soothingly.</p>

<p>76. “I say it did,” replied the other.
“There was no thought about it; I
had just&mdash;What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>77. His wife made no reply. She
was watching the mysterious movements
of a man outside, who, peering
in an undecided fashion at the
house, appeared to be trying to make
up his mind to enter. In mental
connection with the two hundred
pounds, she noticed that the stranger
was well dressed, and wore a silk
hat of glossy newness. Three times
he paused at the gate, and then walked
on again. The fourth time he
stood with his hand upon it, and then
with sudden resolution flung it open
and walked up the path. Mrs. White<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
at the same moment placed her hands
behind her, and hurriedly unfastening
the strings of her apron, put that useful
article of apparel beneath the
cushion of her chair.</p>

<p>78. She brought the stranger, who
seemed ill at ease, into the room. He
gazed at her furtively, and listened in
a preoccupied fashion as the old lady
apologized for the appearance of the
room, and her husband’s coat, a garment
which he usually reserved for
the garden. She then waited as patiently
as her sex would permit, for
him to broach his business, but he
was at first strangely silent.</p>

<p>79. “I&mdash;was asked to call,” he said
at last, and stooped and picked a
piece of cotton from his trousers. “I
come from Maw and Meggins.”</p>

<p>80. The old lady started. “Is anything
the matter?” she asked, breathlessly.
“Has anything happened to
Herbert? What is it? What is it?”</p>

<p>81. Her husband interposed.
“There, there, mother,” he said,
hastily. “Sit down, and don’t jump
to conclusions. You’ve not brought
bad news, I’m sure, sir;” and he eyed
the other wistfully.</p>

<p>82. “I’m sorry&mdash;” began the visitor.</p>

<p>83. “Is he hurt?” demanded the
mother, wildly.</p>

<p>84. The visitor bowed in assent.
“Badly hurt,” he said, quietly, “but
he is not in any pain.”</p>

<p>85. “Oh, thank God!” said the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
woman, clasping her hands. “Thank
God for that! Thank&mdash;”</p>

<p>86. She broke off suddenly as the
sinister meaning of the assurance
dawned upon her and she saw the
awful confirmation of her fears in
the other’s averted face. She caught
her breath, and turning to her
slower-witted husband, laid her
trembling old hand upon his. There
was a long silence.</p>

<p>87. “He was caught in the machinery,”
said the visitor at length in a
low voice.</p>

<p>88. “Caught in the machinery,” repeated
Mr. White, in a dazed fashion,
“yes.”</p>

<p>89. He sat staring blankly out at
the window, and taking his wife’s
hand between his own, pressed it as
he had been wont to do in their old
courting-days nearly forty years before.</p>

<p>90. “He was the only one left to
us,” he said, turning gently to the
visitor. “It is hard.”</p>

<p>91. The other coughed, and rising,
walked slowly to the window. “The
firm wished me to convey their
sincere sympathy with you in your
great loss,” he said, without looking
round. “I beg that you will understand
I am only their servant and
merely obeying orders.”</p>

<p>92. There was no reply; the old
woman’s face was white, her eyes
staring, and her breath inaudible; on
the husband’s face was a look such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
as his friend the sergeant might have
carried into his first action.</p>

<p>93. “I was to say that Maw and
Meggins disclaim all responsibility,”
continued the other. “They admit
no liability at all, but in consideration
of your son’s services, they wish to
present you with a certain sum as
compensation.”</p>

<p>94. Mr. White dropped his wife’s
hand, and rising to his feet, gazed
with a look of horror at his visitor.
His dry lips shaped the words.
“How much?”</p>

<p>95. “Two hundred pounds,” was
the answer.</p>

<p>96. Unconscious of his wife’s
shriek, the old man smiled faintly, put
out his hands like a sightless man,
and dropped, a senseless heap, to the
floor.</p>


<p class="p2 center">III</p>

<p>97. In the huge new cemetery, some
two miles distant, the old people buried
their dead, and came back to a
house steeped in shadow and silence.
It was all over so quickly that at first
they could hardly realize it, and remained
in a state of expectation as
though of something else to happen&mdash;something
else which was to
lighten this load, too heavy for old
hearts to bear.</p>

<p>98. But the days passed, and expectation
gave place to resignation&mdash;the
hopeless resignation of the old,
sometimes miscalled, apathy. Sometimes
they hardly exchanged a word,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
for now they had nothing to talk
about, and their days were long to
weariness.</p>

<p>99. It was about a week after that
the old man, waking suddenly in the
night, stretched out his hand and
found himself alone. The room was
in darkness, and the sound of subdued
weeping came from the window. He
raised himself in bed and listened.</p>

<p>100. “Come back,” he said, tenderly.
“You will be cold.”</p>

<p>101. “It is colder for my son,” said
the old woman, and wept afresh.</p>

<p>102. The sound of her sobs died
away on his ears. The bed was
warm, and his eyes heavy with sleep.
He dozed fitfully, and then slept until
a sudden wild cry from his wife
awoke him with a start.</p>

<p>103. “The paw!” she cried wildly.
“The monkey’s paw!”</p>

<p>104. He started up in alarm.
“Where? Where is it? What’s the
matter?”</p>

<p>105. She came stumbling across the
room toward him. “I want it,” she
said, quietly. “You’ve not destroyed
it?”</p>

<p>106. “It’s in the parlour, on the
bracket,” he replied marvelling.
“Why?”</p>

<p>107. She cried and laughed together,
and bending over, kissed his
cheek.</p>

<p>108. “I only just thought of it,”
she said, hysterically. “Why didn’t
I think of it before? Why didn’t you
think of it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>109. “Think of what?” he questioned.</p>

<p>110. “The other two wishes,” she
replied, rapidly. “We’ve only had
one.”</p>

<p>111. “Was not that enough?” he
demanded, fiercely.</p>

<p>112. “No,” she cried, triumphantly;
“we’ll have one more. Go down and
get it quickly, and wish our boy alive
again.”</p>

<p>113. The man sat up in bed and
flung the bed-clothes from his quaking
limbs. “Good God, you are
mad!” he cried, aghast.</p>

<p>114. “Get it,” she panted; “get it
quickly, and wish&mdash;Oh, my boy, my
boy!”</p>

<p>115. Her husband struck a match
and lit the candle. “Get back to
bed,” he said, unsteadily. “You
don’t know what you are saying.”</p>

<p>116. “We had the first wish granted,”
said the old woman, feverishly;
“why not the second?”</p>

<p>117. “A coincidence,” stammered
the old man.</p>

<p>118. “Go and get it and wish,”
cried his wife, quivering with excitement.</p>

<p>119. The old man turned and regarded
her, and his voice shook.
“He has been dead ten days, and besides
he&mdash;I would not tell you else,
but&mdash;I could only recognize him by
his clothing. If he was too terrible
for you to see then, how now?”</p>

<p>120. “Bring him back,” cried the
old woman, and dragged him toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
the door. “Do you think I fear the
child I have nursed?”</p>

<p>121. He went down in the darkness,
and felt his way to the parlour,
and then to the mantelpiece. The
talisman was in its place, and a horrible
fear that the unspoken wish
might bring his mutilated son before
him ere he could escape from the
room seized upon him, and he caught
his breath as he found that he had
lost the direction of the door. His
brow cold with sweat, he felt his
way round the table, and groped along
the wall until he found himself in
the small passage with the unwholesome
thing in his hand.</p>

<p>122. Even his wife’s face seemed
changed as he entered the room. It
was white and expectant, and to his
fears seemed to have an unnatural
look upon it. He was afraid of her.</p>

<p>123. “Wish!” she cried in a
strong voice.</p>

<p>124. “It is foolish and wicked,” he
faltered.</p>

<p>125. “Wish!” repeated his wife.</p>

<p>126. He raised his hand. “I wish
my son alive again.”</p>

<p>127. The talisman fell to the floor,
and he regarded it fearfully. Then
he sank trembling into a chair as the
old woman, with burning eyes, walked
to the window and raised the
blind.</p>

<p>128. He sat until he was chilled
with the cold, glancing occasionally at
the figure of the old woman peering
through the window. The candle-end,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
which had burned below the rim
of the china candle-stick, was throwing
pulsating shadows on the ceilings
and walls, until, with a flicker larger
than the rest, it expired. The old
man, with an unspeakable sense of
relief at the failure of the talisman,
crept back to his bed, and a minute or
two afterward the old woman came
silently and apathetically beside him.</p>

<p>129. Neither spoke, but lay silently
listening to the ticking of the clock.
A stair creaked, and a squeaky mouse
scurried noisily through the wall.
The darkness was oppressive, and after
lying for some time screwing up
his courage, he took the box of
matches, and striking one, went
downstairs for a candle.</p>

<p>130. At the foot of the stairs the
match went out, and he paused to
strike another; and at the same
moment a knock, so quiet and stealthy
as to be scarcely audible, sounded on
the front door.</p>

<p>131. The matches fell from his
hand and spilled in the passage. He
stood motionless, his breath suspended
until the knock was repeated.
Then he turned and fled swiftly back
to his room, and closed the door behind
him. A third knock sounded
through the house.</p>

<p>132. “What’s that?” cried the old
woman, starting up.</p>

<p>133. “A rat,” said the old man in
shaking tones&mdash;“a rat. It passed
me on the stairs.”</p>

<p>134. His wife sat up in bed listening.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
A loud knock resounded
through the house.</p>

<p>135. “It’s Herbert!” she screamed,
“It’s Herbert!”</p>

<p>136. She ran to the door, but her
husband was before her, and catching
her by the arm, held her tightly.</p>

<p>137. “What are you going to do?”
he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>138. “It’s my boy; it’s Herbert!”
she cried, struggling mechanically.
“I forgot it was two miles away.
What are you holding me for? Let
go. I must open the door.”</p>

<p>139. “For God’s sake don’t let it
in,” cried the old man, trembling.</p>

<p>140. “You’re afraid of your own
son,” she cried, struggling. “Let me
go. I’m coming, Herbert; I’m coming.”</p>

<p>141. There was another knock, and
another. The old woman with a sudden
wrench broke free and ran from
the room. Her husband followed to
the landing, and called after her appealingly
as she hurried downstairs.
He heard the chain rattle back and
the bottom bolt drawn slowly and
stiffly from the socket. Then the old
woman’s voice, strained and panting.</p>

<p>142. “The bolt,” she cried, loudly.
“Come down. I can’t reach it.”</p>

<p>143. But her husband was on his
hands and knees groping wildly on
the floor in search of the paw. If he
could only find it before the thing
outside got in. A perfect fusillade of
knocks reverberated through the
house, and he heard the scraping of
a chair as his wife put it down in
the passage against the door. He
heard the creaking of the bolt as it
came slowly back, and at the same
moment he found the monkey’s paw,
and frantically breathed his third and
last wish.</p>

<p>144. The knocking ceased suddenly,
although the echoes of it were still in
the house. He heard the chair drawn
back, and the door opened. A cold
wind rushed up the staircase, and a
long loud wail of disappointment and
misery from his wife gave him
courage to run down to her side, and
then to the gate beyond. The street
lamp flickering opposite shone on a
quiet and deserted road.</p>

<p class="p1">In painting we may represent any fine figure we please; but

only draw a beautiful young man winged: but what painting
can furnish out any thing so grand as the addition of one word,
“the angel of the <em>Lord</em>?...” Now, as there is a moving tone of
voice, an impassioned countenance, an agitated gesture, which
affect independently of the things about which they are exerted,
so there are words, and certain dispositions of words, which
being peculiarly devoted to passionate subjects, and always used
by those who are under the influence of any passion, touch and
move us more than those which far more clearly and distinctly
express the subject-matter. We yield to sympathy what we refuse

<h3>STORIES OF EMOTION</h3>
</div>


<p>Fictional plots deal with the inner man quite as often
as with the outer. Indeed, the action of the soul is more
real, intense and interesting than mere visible action could
possibly be. For this reason the master story-tellers
nearly always interpret the inner life&mdash;whether of
thought, of emotion, or of decision&mdash;by displaying the
outer, instead of by merely analyzing and discussing the
thoughts, feelings and decisions of their characters.
The more clearly this outer action pictures the inner man,
the more real does the character become to us and the
more perfectly do we grasp the whole story.</p>

<p>As a universal human experience, emotion<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> mingles
with all manifestations of life. In the short-story it finds
various expression in the hilarious fun of “Pigs is Pigs,”
by Butler; the character humor of Barrie’s “Thrums”
stories; the mingled humor and pathos of Harte’s “The
Luck of Roaring Camp”; the patriotic sentiment of
Daudet’s “The Siege of Berlin”; the mystic sympathy
of Kipling’s “They”; the idyllic love of the Book of
Ruth; the incomparable psychological insight of Maupassant’s
“A Coward”; the cold, revengeful jealousy of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>Balzac’s “La Grande Bretêche”; the choking, supernatural
terror of Poe’s “The Pit and the Pendulum”;
the tragic passion of Mérimée’s “Mateo Falcone,” and all
the myriad shades and combinations of shades which lie
between.</p>

<p>Naturally, each story in this entire collection illustrates
one or another emotional phase, as even a cursory reading
will make clear. What, for example, could be more
intense than the emotions of those two parents, as depicted
in “The Monkey’s Paw?” But for this group
two stories have been selected as being typical examples
of emotional expression, because in them human feeling
predominates over all other characteristics and really
makes the story.</p>

<p>“The Last Class,” which is here presented in a translation
by the editor of this volume, is rich in local color,
in impressionism, and in character drawing, but as an
unaffected picture of patriotic feeling it is unsurpassed
in the literature of the short-story. There is not a single
jarring emotional tone, not the slightest exaggeration of
true emotional values. With singular repression, Daudet
secures his effects by suggesting rather than fully expressing
the profound feelings of the school-master, his pupils,
and the visitors; and when the majestically simple climax
is reached, we have accepted the reality of it all and have
received a single effective and lasting impression.</p>

<p>“Without Benefit of Clergy,” the second specimen, is
left for the reader to analyze and discuss. Surely this
most sadly touching of all love-stories presents the
poignant pity, the inevitable disaster, the final heart-break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
of unsanctified love, as never before or since in the pages
of fiction.</p>


<h3>DAUDET AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>Alphonse Daudet was born at Nîmes, France, May
13, 1840. Here and at Lyons he received his education.
At the age of seventeen he and his brother Ernest went
to Paris, where Alphonse published his first long poem
two years later. This began his literary success. From
1860 to 1865 he served as secretary in the Cabinet of the
Duke de Morny, and at the early age of twenty-five was
decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honor. He
was profoundly impressed by the memories of his early
life and frequently revisited his native Provence. The
South-of-France tone is distinguishable in much of his
work, just as the powerful feelings called forth by the
Franco-Prussian war find expression in other of his
writings. He died in Paris, December 16, 1897.</p>

<p>Alphonse Daudet was a dramatist, poet, novelist, and
short-story writer. <em>The Nabob</em>, <em>Sappho</em>, <em>Jack</em>, <em>Kings in
Exile</em>, <em>Numa Roumestan</em>, <em>Fromont and Risler</em>, <em>The
Evangelist</em>, and the “Tartarin” books are his best known
novels. Among his best short-stories are “The Pope’s
Mule,” “The Death of the Dauphin,” “The Three Low
Masses,” “The Elixir of the Reverend Father Gaucher,”
“Old Folks,” and “Master Cornille’s Secret”&mdash;all from
the collection, <em>Letters from My Mill</em>. The following
little masterpieces are from his <em>Monday Tales</em>: “The
Game of Billiards,” “The Child Spy,” “The Little Pies,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
“Mothers,” “The Siege of Berlin,” and “The Last
Class.”</p>

<p>At the close of the Franco-Prussian war, in 1871,
France was forced to cede to Germany almost all of
Alsace, about nine thousand square miles of territory, in
addition to an indemnity of one billion dollars. “The
Last Class” was held, therefore, about 1872, and the
story was first published in 1873.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Daudet’s literary genius sounded every note, from
farce, delicate humor, and satire, to poetic pathos, dramatic
action, character analysis, and social criticism. He
resembled Dickens in his humor, but displayed more
emotional tenderness, and, in his later work, more satire,
than did the English writer. Though he may be called
the literary descendant of Balzac, whose novels systematically
depicted French society in all its phases, Daudet
was less a social philosopher and more a man expressing
his own personality through his work. Comparing him
with Maupassant, we find his stories less perfect in form,
but far richer in human feeling. Though at times he
dealt with subjects which English readers consider broad,
his sympathy unmistakably appears to be with his nobler
characters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When only ten years of age, I was already haunted at times
by the desire to lose my own personality, and incarnate myself
in other beings; the mania was already laying hold of me for
observing and analyzing, and my chief amusement during my
walks was to pick out some passerby, and to follow him all over
Lyons, through all his idle strollings or busy occupations, striving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
to identify myself with his life, and to enter into his innermost
thoughts.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Alphonse Daudet</span>, <em>Thirty Years of Paris</em>.</p>


<p>Daudet expresses many things; but he most frequently expresses
himself&mdash;his own temper in the presence of life, his own
feeling on a thousand occasions.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry James</span>, <em>Partial Portraits</em>.</p>


<p>Life, as he knows it, is sad, full of disappointment, bitterness,
and suffering; and yet the conclusion he draws from experience
is that this life, with all its sadness, is well worth living.&mdash;<span class="smcap">René
Doumic</span>, <em>Contemporary French Novelists</em>.</p>


<p>The short stories are Daudet at his best, a style tense, virile,
full of suppressed energy.... There is a nobler strain in these
stories than speaks from the pages of <em>Le Petit Chose</em> [“Little
What’s-His-Name”],&mdash;the ring of passionate patriotism, no
longer the voice of Provence, or of Paris, but the voice of
France.... The touching story, <em>La Dernière Classe</em>, might have
come from the lips of an Alsatian, so true is it to the spirit of
Alsace during those sorrowful days that followed the Franco-Prussian
War.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Marion McIntyre</span>, Introduction to <em>Works</em>.</p>


<p>Daudet’s two main series of stories (<em>Letters from My Mill</em> and
<em>Monday Tales</em>) contain between sixty and seventy pieces....
They represent Daudet the poet, with his exquisite fancy, his
winning charm, his subtle, indescribable style, his susceptibility
to all that is lovely and joyous in nature and in human life;
in short, in his sunny, mercurial Provençal temperament....
But there was another Daudet more or less superimposed upon
this sunny, poetic Daudet, true child of Provence. Upon few
Frenchmen of a generation ago did the terrible years of the
Franco-Prussian War and the Commune produce a more sobering
impression. The romanticist and poet deepened into a realistic
observer of human life in all its phases.&mdash;<span class="smcap">W. P. Trent</span>,
Introduction to the volume on Daudet, in <em>Little French Masterpieces</em>.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>


<p>The charm reflected in his works lay in the man himself, and
earned for him a host of friends and an unclouded domestic life&mdash;it
lay in his open, sunny, inconsequent, southern nature, with
his quick sympathies, his irony at once forcible and delicate, his
ready tears. It lay in the spontaneousness of his talent, in
his Provençal gift of improvisation.... And it lay, too, in what
was an essential characteristic of his nature, his rapid alternation
of mood. Take even the slightest of his <em>Contes</em> [stories]....
Within a few pages he is in turn sad, gay, sentimental, ironical,
pathetic, and one mood glides into the next without jar or friction.&mdash;<span class="smcap">V.
M. Crawford</span>, <em>Studies in Foreign Literature</em>.</p>


<p>His stories first of all amuse, excite, distress himself....
He never could, indeed, look on them disinterestedly, either while
they were making or when they were made. He made them
with actual tears and laughter; and they are read with actual
tears and laughter by the crowd.... But he had no philosophy
behind his fantastic and yet only too probable creations. Caring,
as he thought, supremely for life, he cared really for that surprising,
bewildering pantomime which life seems to be to those
who watch its coloured movement, its flickering lights, its changing
costumes, its powdered faces, without looking through the
eyes into the hearts of the dancers. He wrote from the very
midst of the human comedy; and it is from this that he seems
at times to have caught the bodily warmth and the taste of the
tears and the very ring of the laughter of men and women....&mdash;<span class="smcap">Arthur
Symons</span>, <em>Studies in Prose and Verse</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Introduction</span> plunges us at
once into the action.
There is one main incident
throughout. The narrator
is immediately seen
to be a child, and surmised
to be a boy.</div>

<p>That morning I was very late for
school, so I was terribly afraid of a
scolding&mdash;particularly since Master
Hamel had said that he would examine
us on participles, and I knew
not the first word about them! For
a little while I thought of playing
truant and wandering the fields.</p>

<p>2. The day was so warm, so clear!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Setting. Note how the rural
community is suggested.</div>

<p>3. I could hear the blackbirds
whistling on the border of the wood;
and back of the sawmill, in the Rippert
field, the Prussian soldiers were
drilling. All of this was much more
tempting to me than participial rules&mdash;but
I was strong enough to resist
and away to school I ran, as fast as
I could.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Small municipalities have
mayors, in France.</div>


<p>4. As I passed by the mayor’s office,
I observed that a number of people
were assembled before the little board
on which notices were generally posted.<span class="sidenote">The tone is struck here.
Forecast of crisis.</span>
For two years every piece of
bad news had come from that board&mdash;defeats
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
in battle, <span class="sidenote">Franco-Prussian War.</span>conscriptions, orders
from headquarters&mdash;and, without
stopping, I wondered:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forecasts a crisis.</div>

<p>5. “What can it be this time!”</p>

<p>6. Just then, as I was running
across the square, Wachter the blacksmith,<span class="sidenote">Note the Prussian name.
Alsace was a border province.</span>
who with his apprentice stood
reading the placard, called after me:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hint of crisis to come.
<span class="smcap">Contributory Incident</span>.</div>

<p>7. “You needn’t hurry so fast,
my lad, you’ll get to school soon
enough!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The school was held in the
master’s house.</div>

<p>8. I thought he was making game
of me, and I kept right on, reaching
Master Hamel’s little yard quite out
of breath.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unusual air depicted by contrast.<br />
The story proper begins.</div>

<p>9. Ordinarily, as school was opening,
the uproar was so great that it
could be heard clear out on the street&mdash;desk-lids
opening and shutting, lessons
droned aloud in unison, pupils
holding their ears shut to learn their <span class="sidenote">An old custom.</span>
lessons easier, while the master’s
great ferrule beat upon the desks:</p>

<p>10. “A little quietness!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrast.</div>

<p>11. I had counted on all this noise
to enable me to reach my seat unnoticed;
but on that particular day
everything was as quiet as a Sabbath
morning. Through the open window
I saw my schoolmates already ranged
in their places, and Master Hamel
pacing to and fro, his formidable iron
ferrule under his arm. In the midst
of that complete silence I had to
open the door and go in! You can
well imagine whether I blushed and
was afraid!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrast.</div>

<p>12. But, quite to the contrary,
Master Hamel looked at me with no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
sign of anger, and then very gently
said:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Evidently a small school.</div>

<p>13. “Go directly to your seat, my
little Frantz&mdash;we were about to begin
without you.”</p>


<p>14. Immediately I stepped over the
bench and sat down at my desk.<span class="sidenote">At which others were also
seated.</span>
Only then, when I had partly gotten
over my fright, did I observe that
our master was wearing his handsome
blue riding-coat, his plaited ruff,
and his black silk embroidered
breeches&mdash;worn only on inspection
days or when prizes were awarded.<span class="sidenote">All the contrasts prepare us
for the crisis.</span>
Furthermore, there was something
extraordinary, something solemn,
about the whole school. But what
astounded me more than anything
else was to see a number of people
from the village sitting, as silent
as we, on the usually empty benches
at the back of the room: old Father
Hauser <span class="sidenote">Prussian name.</span>with his three-cornered hat,
the ex-mayor, the former postman,
besides a number of others. All
seemed cast down, and Father Hauser
had brought with him an old
primer, with chewed up leaves, <span class="sidenote">Dazed.</span>
which he held wide-open up-side-down
on his knees, and lying on it
his huge spectacles.</p>

<p>15. While I was marvelling at all
this, Master Hamel had mounted
his platform, and in the same gentle
and serious voice with which he had
greeted me, he said to us:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Foundation of Climax.</span>
Summary of the theme.
Compare with Longfellow’s
<em>Evangeline</em>.</div>



<p>16. “My children, this is the last
day that I shall keep school. The
order has come from Berlin that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
nothing but German shall be taught
in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine.<span class="sidenote">This law went into effect
July 1, 1870.</span>
The new school-master will
arrive to-morrow. This is the last
class in French&mdash;I beg of you to
be very attentive!”</p>

<p>17. His simple words overwhelmed
me. This, then, was the notice they
had posted at the mayor’s office. Oh,
the scoundrels!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The crisis becomes personal.</div>

<p>18. My last lesson in French!</p>



<p>19. And I was scarcely able to
write! Then I was never to learn!
I must stop short just where I was!<span class="sidenote">Scarcely a paragraph but appeals
to emotion in some
form.</span>
How angry with myself it made me
to remember the time I had frittered
away, and the lessons I had missed
while hunting birds’ nests or sliding
on the Saar! My books now seemed
to me like old comrades from
whom it broke my heart to part, and <span class="sidenote">The <em>Saar</em> flows northward
into the <em>Moselle</em>.</span>
only a moment since I had found
them&mdash;my grammar, my sacred history&mdash;so
dull, and so heavy to carry!
It was just the same when I thought
of Master Hamel. He was going
away. I should never see him again&mdash;the
thought made me forget all his
punishments and strokes with the
ferrule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shift to interest in the
Master.</div>

<p>20. Poor old man! So it was in
honor of that last lesson in French
that he had donned his Sunday best&mdash;and
now I understood why those
old folks from the village were seated
at the back of the room. <span class="sidenote">Now to the villagers.</span> It seemed
to say they regretted that they had
not visited the school oftener. <span class="sidenote">Age indicated, thus adding
to the pathos.</span> Besides,
it was a sort of way of thanking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
our teacher for his forty years
of devoted service, and of showing <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">These are the key words.</span></span>
their love for the fatherland which
was passing away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note how Daudet arouses
our sympathies by avoiding
generalities and centering
our interest upon
persons.</div>

<p>21. Just at this point in my reflections
I heard my name called&mdash;it
was my turn to recite. Oh, I would
have given anything to be able to
recite without a slip, in a strong,
clear voice, that celebrated rule about
participles; but at the very first
words I grew confused and I only
stood there at my bench swaying
back and forward, my heart swelling,
not daring to lift my head. At
length I heard Master Hamel saying
to me:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ordinary rebuke is swallowed
up in the great
common sorrow.</div>


<p>22. “My little Frantz, I shall not
scold you; you are punished enough,
I think. It is so with all of us; every
day we reassure ourselves: ‘Bah! I
have plenty of time. To-morrow I
shall learn.’ Then you see what happens.
Alas! it has ever been the
great misfortune of our Alsace to defer
its lessons until the morrow.<span class="sidenote">Daudet here teaches all
France a lesson&mdash;and all
nations as well.</span>
And now these people are justified in
saying to us, ‘What, you pretend to
be French, and you are able neither
to speak nor to write your language!’
But in all this you are not the most
guilty one, my poor Frantz&mdash;we are
all worthy of a full measure of self-reproach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note M. Hamel’s simple
sincerity.</div>


<p>23. “Your parents have not taken
enough care to see that you got an
education. They preferred to save a
few more sous by putting you to
work in the fields or in the factories.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
And I&mdash;have I nothing for which
to blame myself? Have I not frequently
sent you to water my garden
instead of keeping you at your books?
Or have I ever hesitated to dismiss
school when I wanted to go trout-fishing?”</p>

<p>24. So Master Hamel, passing from
one theme to another, began to speak
to us about our French language.
He said that it was the most beautiful
language in the whole world&mdash;the
most clear, the most substantial;
that we must ever cherish it among
ourselves, and never forget it, for
when a nation falls into bondage, just
so long as it clings to its language, it
holds the key of its prison.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The attention follows the
lead of the emotions.</div>

<p>25. Then he took a grammar and
read us our lesson. I was astonished
to see how readily I understood!
Everything he said seemed to me so
easy&mdash;so very easy. I believe that
never before had I listened so attentively,
and that he, in turn, had
never explained things with such <span class="sidenote">So does the teacher’s skill.</span>
infinite patience. It almost seemed as
though the poor fellow wished to
impart all his knowledge to us before
he left us&mdash;to drive it all into our
heads with one blow.</p>




<p>26. The lesson ended, we went on
to the exercises in penmanship. For
that day Master Hamel had gotten
ready some entirely new copies on
which he had written in a neat, round
hand: “France, Alsace, France, Alsace.”<span class="sidenote">A proof of unusual absorption.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
The slips of paper looked like
tiny flags, waving all about the room
and hanging from the rods of our
desks. You should have seen how
diligently everyone worked, and how
quiet it was! Only the scratching of
the pens over the paper could be
heard. Once some beetles flew in, but
nobody paid any attention to them&mdash;not
even the very smallest chaps, who
were struggling to draw their oblique
lines with a will and an application
as sincere as though even the lines
themselves were French....<span class="sidenote">Note the pathos of the appeal.</span>
Pigeons cooed in low tones on the
roof of the schoolhouse, and as I
listened to them I thought to myself:</p>

<p>27. “I wonder if they are going to
make them coo in German too!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A picture. All of these contributory
pictures stand
in lieu of contributory incidents.
The whole is
highly unified.</div>


<p>28. Now and then, as I lifted my
eyes from my task, I saw Master
Hamel seated motionless in his chair,
and staring at things about him as
though in that look he would carry
away with him the whole of his
little schoolhouse. Think of it! For
forty years he had occupied that same
place, his yard in front of him, and
his school always unchanged. Only
the benches and desks were rubbed by
use until they were polished; the
walnuts in the yard had grown large,
and the hop-vine he himself had
planted now hung in festoons from <span class="sidenote">The lad reasons as a lad&mdash;to
him the pathos is not
for himself but for the
old man.</span>
the windows clear to the roof. How
heartbreaking it must have been for
that poor man to leave all this&mdash;to
hear his sister moving to and fro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
in the room overhead as she packed
their trunks! Next day they were
going away&mdash;to leave the fatherland
forever.</p>

<p>29. All the same, he had the courage
to keep the school to the very
closing minute. The writing over,
we had our lesson in history. Then
the little ones sang in unison their
<em>ba, be, bi, bo, bu</em>. Yonder, at the back
of the room, old Father Hauser was
holding his spelling-book with both
hands, and with the aid of his great
spectacles he spelled out the letters&mdash;one
could see that even he too was
applying himself. Emotion shook his
voice, and to hear him was so droll
that we all wanted to laugh&mdash;and to
cry. Ah! I shall always remember
that last class.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Preparation for Climax.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Formal Crisis</span>&mdash;the end
approaches.<br />
Note the force of this.<br />
Moral qualities affect the physical.</div>

<p>30. Suddenly the church clock
sounded twelve. Then the Angelus.
At the same instant were heard under
our very windows the trumpets of
the Prussians returning from drill.
Pale as death, Master Hamel rose
from his chair. Never had he seemed
so large.</p>

<p>31. “My friends,” he began; “my
friends, I&mdash;I&mdash;”</p>

<p>32. But something choked him.
He could not end the sentence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the intensity.</div>

<p>33. Then he turned to the blackboard,
seized a piece of chalk, and,
bearing with all his strength, he
wrote in the largest letters he could
make:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Full Climax.</span></div>

<p>34. “VIVE LA FRANCE!”</p>

<p>35. Then he stood there, his head
leaning against the wall, and without
a word he signed to us with his
hand:</p>

<p>36. “It is the end ... go!”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<h3>KIPLING AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>Joseph Rudyard Kipling was born in Bombay, India,
December 30, 1865, of English parents, his father, J.
Lockwood Kipling, an artist of ability, having been in
the colonial Civil Service. He was educated at the
United Services College, Devon, but returned to India in
1882 and became an editorial writer and correspondent.
In 1889 he began extensive travels. For several years
he resided in Brattleboro, Vermont, but returned to England
and settled in Rottingdean, Sussex.</p>

<p>Rudyard Kipling has attained celebrity as poet, novelist,
and short-story writer. His best-known poems are
found in the collections entitled <em>Departmental Ditties</em>,
<em>Barrack-Room Ballads</em>, <em>The Seven Seas</em>, and <em>The Five
Nations</em>. <em>Kim</em> is his ablest novel. The two “Jungle
Books” constitute a remarkable collection of connected
tales of the jungle folk. His best short-stories are found
in the following volumes: <em>Soldiers Three</em> (the “Mulvaney”
stories, “The Man Who Was,” etc.), <em>The Phantom
Rickshaw</em> (“The Man Who Would be King,” “The
Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes,” etc.), <em>Wee Willie
Winkie and Other Stories</em> (“The Drums of the Fore and Aft,”
“Under the Deodars,” etc.), <em>The Day’s Work</em> (“The
Bridge Builders,” “The Brushwood Boy,” etc.), and

(London) in June, 1890, and in the June 7th and
14th, 1890, numbers of <em>Harper’s Weekly</em> (New York).
In the same year it was published in the volume, <em>The
Courting of Dinah Shadd, and Other Stories</em>, but in 1891
it was included in the volume <em>Life’s Handicap: being
Stories of Mine Own People.</em></p>

<p>Rudyard Kipling is without doubt the greatest of living
short-story writers, though in interest his later fiction
does not equal his productions of the early nineties. His
journalistic work drilled him in compression; his precocious
intuitions and personal experience of life in
India opened up a fresh and fascinating field; his genius
taught him how to tell his stories with unfailing variety,
a robust humor, and an understanding of the human
heart quite uncanny in one so young. In style, he is a
master of the unexpected; in narration, he is by turns
deliberate and swift; in atmospheric painting, he transports
us to real places, wherein real folk do real things.</p>

<p class="p1">Tell them first of those things that thou hast seen and they
have seen together. Thus their knowledge will piece out thy imperfections.
Tell them of what thou alone hast seen, then what
thou hast heard, and since they be children tell them of battles
and kings, horses, devils, elephants, and angels, but omit not to
tell them of love and such like. All the earth is full of tales
to him who listens and does not drive away the poor from his
door. The poor are the best of tale-tellers; for they must lay
their ear to the ground every night.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rudyard Kipling</span>, Preface
to <em>Life’s Handicap</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>The tremulous passion of Ameera, her hopes, her fears, and
her agonies of disappointment, combine to form by far the most
tender page which Mr. Kipling has written.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edmund Gosse</span>,
<em>Questions at Issue</em>.</p>


<p>... The truly appreciative reader should surely have no quarrel
with the primitive element in Mr. Kipling’s subject-matter,
or with what, for want of a better name, I may call his love of
low life. What is that but essentially a part of his freshness?
And for what part of his freshness are we exactly more thankful
than for just this smart jostle that he gives the old stupid superstition
that the amiability of a story-teller is the amiability of
the people he represents&mdash;that their vulgarity, or depravity, or
gentility, or fatuity are tantamount to the same qualities in the
painter himself?&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry James</span>, Introduction to <em>Works</em>.</p>

<p>It was not until “Without Benefit of Clergy” that he came
to his full strength in pathetic prose. The history of Ameera is
one of the triumphs of the short story. Its characterization is
vivid; its progress direct and poignant. I do not wish even for
an instant to seem to cheapen one of the most touching and
beautiful stories in the world when I call it journalism. But
the voice of the desolate mother breaking into the nursery rime
of the wicked crow,</p>

<p class="indent10"><small>“And the wild plums grow in the jungle, only a penny a pound,<br />
Only a penny a pound, baba&mdash;only&mdash;,”</small></p>

<p>and every pathetic moment, is chosen by an inspired sense for
what would most feelingly grasp the interest of the reader. This
is high art, with intense feeling behind it&mdash;otherwise it would
not be so excellent. But it is also good journalism.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry
Seidel Canby</span>, <em>The Short-Story in English.</em></p>

<p>For Mr. Kipling to write a story without some firm human
touch, however slight, would be impossible.... In his effects
Mr. Kipling is usually photographic (“cinematographic” is better),
but his methods are almost invariably, for want of a better
word, “artistic.” I mean that whereas the principle of selection,
which is a vital principle of art, can operate but little in photography,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
it is seen to be remarkably active in all Mr. Kipling’s
best work. His stories, so to speak, represent the epigram of
action, the epigram of a given situation.... It is from the
lives of such Englishmen ... that Mr. Kipling has gathered so
many of his vivid anecdotes. A great number of them ... are
the lesser lights and darks contributing to such more serious
elements of the general picture as “At the End of the Passage,”
“Without Benefit of Clergy,” “In Flood Time,” “The Man Who
Was,” behind which looms vast in the background the image of
that old Sphinx of the Plains complete in mystery as no other
writer has ever been able to suggest her.... Also he had written
at least one love-story (“Without Benefit of Clergy”) that
broke one’s heart.... For all the humour and buoyancy of his
writings, Mr. Kipling is at heart a pessimist, and, perhaps, his
sincerest expression of opinion in regard to the government of
the universe is contained in the fierce Omarian exclamation of
Holden in “Without Benefit of Clergy,” addressed to no one in
particular, but evidently meant to reach far up into the skies:
“O you brute! You utter brute!” So Omar bade Allah “man’s
forgiveness give and take.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard Le Gallienne</span>, <em>Rudyard
Kipling: A Criticism</em>.</p>

<p>“But if it be a girl?”</p>

<p>2. “Lord of my life, it cannot be.
I have prayed for so many nights,
and sent gifts to Sheikh Badl’s shrine
so often, that I know God will give
us a son&mdash;a man-child that shall
grow into a man. Think of this and
be glad. My mother shall be his
mother till I can take him again, and
the mullah of the Pattan mosque
shall cast his nativity&mdash;God send he
be born in an auspicious hour!&mdash;and
then, thou wilt never weary of
me, thy slave.”</p>

<p>3. “Since when hast thou been a
slave, my queen?”</p>

<p>4. “Since the beginning&mdash;till this
mercy came to me. How could I be
sure of thy love when I knew that
I had been bought with silver?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>5. “Nay, that was the dowry. I
paid it to thy mother.”</p>

<p>6. “And she has buried it, and sits
upon it all day long like a hen.
What talk is yours of dower! I was
bought as though I had been a Lucknow
dancing-girl instead of a child.”</p>

<p>7. “Art thou sorry for the sale?”</p>

<p>8. “I have sorrowed; but to-day
I am glad. Thou wilt never cease to
love me now?&mdash;answer, my king.”</p>

<p>9. “Never&mdash;never. No.”</p>

<p>10. “Not even though the <em>mem-log</em>&mdash;the
white women of thy own
blood&mdash;love thee? And remember,
I have watched them driving in the
evening; they are very fair.”</p>

<p>11. “I have seen fire-balloons by the
hundred. I have seen the moon, and&mdash;then
I saw no more fire-balloons.”</p>

<p>12. Ameera clapped her hands and
laughed. “Very good talk,” she said.
Then with an assumption of great
stateliness: “It is enough. Thou
hast my permission to depart&mdash;if
thou wilt.”</p>

<p>13. The man did not move. He
was sitting on a low red-lacquered
couch in a room furnished only with
a blue and white floor-cloth, some
rugs, and a very complete collection
of native cushions. At his feet sat
a woman of sixteen, and she was all
but all the world in his eyes. By
every rule and law she should have
been otherwise, for he was an Englishman,
and she a Mussulman’s
daughter bought two years before
from her mother, who, being left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
without money, would have sold
Ameera shrieking to the Prince of
Darkness if the price had been sufficient.</p>

<p>14. It was a contract entered into
with a light heart; but even before
the girl had reached her bloom she
came to fill the greater portion of
John Holden’s life. For her, and
the withered hag, her mother, he had
taken a little house overlooking the
great red-walled city, and found&mdash;when
the marigolds had sprung up by
the well in the courtyard and Ameera
had established herself according
to her own ideas of comfort, and her
mother had ceased grumbling at the
inadequacy of the cooking-places, the
distance from the daily market, and
at matters of housekeeping in general&mdash;that
the house was to him his
home. Any one could enter his
bachelor’s bungalow by day or night,
and the life that he led there was an
unlovely one. In the house in the
city his feet only could pass beyond
the outer courtyard to the women’s
rooms; and when the big wooden
gate was bolted behind him he was
king in his own territory, with Ameera
for queen. And there was going
to be added to this kingdom a third
person whose arrival Holden felt inclined
to resent. It interfered with
his perfect happiness. It disarranged
the orderly peace of the
house that was his own. But Ameera
was wild with delight at the
thought of it, and her mother not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
less so. The love of a man, and
particularly a white man, was at the
best an inconstant affair, but it
might, both women argued, be held
fast by a baby’s hands. “And then,”
Ameera would always say, “then he
will never care for the white <em>mem-log</em>.
I hate them all&mdash;I hate them
all.”</p>

<p>15. “He will go back to his own
people in time,” said the mother;
“but by the blessing of God that
time is yet afar off.”</p>

<p>16. Holden sat silent on the couch
thinking of the future, and his
thoughts were not pleasant. The
drawbacks of a double life are manifold.
The Government, with singular
care, had ordered him out of the
station for a fortnight on special
duty in the place of a man who was
watching by the bedside of a sick
wife. The verbal notification of the
transfer had been edged by a cheerful
remark that Holden ought to think
himself lucky in being a bachelor
and a free man. He came to break
the news to Ameera.</p>

<p>17. “It is not good,” she said
slowly, “but it is not all bad.
There is my mother here, and no
harm will come to me&mdash;unless indeed
I die of pure joy. Go thou to
thy work and think no troublesome
thoughts. When the days are done
I believe ... nay, I am sure. And&mdash;and
then I shall lay <em>him</em> in thy
arms, and thou wilt love me forever.
The train goes to-night, at midnight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
is it not? Go now, and do not let
thy heart be heavy by cause of me.
But thou wilt not delay in returning?
Thou wilt not stay on the road to
talk to the bold white <em>mem-log</em>.
Come back to me swiftly, my life.”</p>

<p>18. As he left the courtyard to
reach his horse that was tethered to
the gate-post, Holden spoke to the
white-haired old watchman who
guarded the house, and bade him
under certain contingencies despatch
the filled-up telegraph-form that Holden
gave him. It was all that could
be done, and with the sensations of
a man who has attended his own
funeral Holden went away by the
night mail to his exile. Every hour
of the day he dreaded the arrival of
the telegram, and every hour of the
night he pictured to himself the death
of Ameera. In consequence his work
for the state was not of first-rate
quality, nor was his temper towards
his colleagues of the most amiable.
The fortnight ended without a sign
from his home, and, torn to pieces
by his anxieties, Holden returned to
be swallowed up for two precious
hours by a dinner at the club, wherein
he heard, as a man hears in a
swoon, voices telling him how execrably
he had performed the other man’s
duties, and how he had endeared
himself to all his associates. Then
he fled on horseback through the
night with his heart in his mouth.
There was no answer at first to his
blows on the gate, and he had just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
wheeled his horse round to kick it in
when Pir Khan appeared with a lantern
and held his stirrup.</p>

<p>19. “Has aught occurred?” said
Holden.</p>

<p>20. “The news does not come from
my mouth, Protector of the Poor,
but&mdash;” He held out his shaking
hand as befitted the bearer of good
news who is entitled to a reward.</p>

<p>21. Holden hurried through the
courtyard. A light burned in the upper
room. His horse neighed in the
gateway, and he heard a shrill little
wail that sent all the blood into the
apple of his throat. It was a new
voice, but it did not prove that
Ameera was alive.</p>

<p>22. “Who is there?” he called up
the narrow brick staircase.</p>

<p>23. There was a cry of delight from
Ameera, and then the voice of the
mother, tremulous with old age and
pride&mdash;“We be two women and&mdash;the
man&mdash;thy&mdash;son.”</p>

<p>24. On the threshold of the room
Holden stepped on a naked dagger,
that was laid there to avert ill-luck,
and it broke at the hilt under his impatient
heel.</p>

<p>25. “God is great!” cooed Ameera
in the half-light. “Thou hast taken
his misfortunes on thy head.”</p>

<p>26. “Ay, but how is it with thee,
life of my life? Old woman, how is
it with her?”</p>

<p>27. “She has forgotten her sufferings
for joy that the child is born.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
There is no harm; but speak softly,”
said the mother.</p>

<p>28. “It only needed thy presence to
make me all well,” said Ameera.
“My king, thou hast been very long
away. What gifts hast thou for me?
Ah, ah! It is I that bring gifts this
time. Look, my life, look! Was
there ever such a babe? Nay, I am
too weak even to clear my arm from
him.”</p>

<p>29. “Rest then, and do not talk.
I am here, <em>bachari</em> [little woman].”</p>

<p>30. “Well said, for there is a bond
and a heel-rope [<em>peecharee</em>] between
us now that nothing can break. Look&mdash;canst
thou see in this light? He
is without spot or blemish. Never
was such a man-child. <em>Ya illah!</em> he
shall be a pundit&mdash;no, a trooper of
the Queen. And, my life, dost thou
love me as well as ever, though I am
faint and sick and worn? Answer
truly.”</p>

<p>31. “Yea. I love as I have loved,
with all my soul. Lie still, pearl,
and rest.”</p>

<p>32. “Then do not go. Sit by my
side here&mdash;so. Mother, the lord of
this house needs a cushion. Bring
it.” There was an almost imperceptible
movement on the part of the
new life that lay in the hollow of
Ameera’s arm. “Aho!” she said,
her voice breaking with love. “The
babe is a champion from his birth.
He is kicking me in the side with
mighty kicks. Was there ever such
a babe! And he is ours to us&mdash;thine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
and mine. Put thy hand on his
head, but carefully, for he is very
young, and men are unskilled in such
matters.”</p>

<p>33. Very cautiously Holden touched
with the tips of his fingers the downy
head.</p>

<p>34. “He is of the faith,” said Ameera;
“for lying here in the night-watches
I whispered the Call to Prayer
and the Profession of Faith into
his ears. And it is most marvellous
that he was born upon a Friday, as
I was born. Be careful of him, my
life; but he can almost grip with his
hands.”</p>

<p>35. Holden found one helpless little
hand that closed feebly on his finger.
And the clutch ran through his body
till it settled about his heart. Till
then his sole thought had been for
Ameera. He began to realise that
there was some one else in the world,
but he could not feel that it was a
veritable son with a soul. He sat
down to think, and Ameera dozed
lightly.</p>

<p>36. “Get hence, <em>sahib</em>,” said her
mother under her breath. “It is not
good that she should find you here
on waking. She must be still.”</p>

<p>37. “I go,” said Holden submissively.
“Here be rupees. See that
my <em>baba</em> gets fat and finds all that
he needs.”</p>

<p>38. The chink of the silver roused
Ameera. “I am his mother, and no
hireling,” she said weakly. “Shall
I look to him more or less for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
sake of money? Mother, give it
back. I have borne my lord a son.”</p>

<p>39. The deep sleep of weakness
came upon her before the sentence
was completed. Holden went down
to the courtyard very softly, with his
heart at ease. Pir Khan, the old
watchman, was chuckling with delight.
“This house is now complete,”
he said, and without further comment
thrust into Holden’s hands the hilt
of a sabre worn many years ago
when he, Pir Khan, served the Queen
in the police. The bleat of a tethered
goat came from the well-curb.</p>

<p>40. “There be two,” said Pir
Khan, “two goats of the best. I
bought them, and they cost much
money; and since there is no birth-party
assembled their flesh will be all
mine. Strike craftily, <em>sahib</em>! ’Tis
an ill-balanced sabre at the best.
Wait till they raise their heads from
cropping the marigolds.”</p>

<p>41. “And why?” said Holden, bewildered.</p>

<p>42. “For the birth-sacrifice. What
else? Otherwise the child being unguarded
from fate may die. The
Protector of the Poor knows the
fitting words to be said.”</p>

<p>43. Holden had learned them once
with little thought that he would ever
speak them in earnest. The touch
of the cold sabre-hilt in his palm turned
suddenly to the clinging grip of
the child up-stairs&mdash;the child that
was his own son&mdash;and a dread of
loss filled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>44. “Strike!” said Pir Khan.
“Never life came into the world but
life was paid for it. See, the goats
have raised their heads. Now!
With a drawing cut!”</p>

<p>45. Hardly knowing what he did,
Holden cut twice as he muttered
the Mohammedan prayer that runs:
“Almighty! In place of this my son
I offer life for life, blood for blood,
head for head, bone for bone, hair
for hair, skin for skin.” The waiting
horse snorted and bounded in
his pickets at the smell of the raw
blood that spirted over Holden’s
riding-boots.</p>

<p>46. “Well smitten!” said Pir
Khan, wiping the sabre. “A swordsman
was lost in thee. Go with a
light heart, heaven-born. I am thy
servant, and the servant of thy son.
May the Presence live a thousand
years and ... the flesh of the goats
is all mine?” Pir Khan drew back
richer by a month’s pay. Holden
swung himself into the saddle and
rode off through the low-hanging
wood-smoke of the evening. He was
full of riotous exultation, alternating
with a vast vague tenderness directed
towards no particular object, that
made him choke as he bent over the
neck of his uneasy horse. “I never
felt like this in my life,” he thought.
“I’ll go to the club and pull myself
together.”</p>

<p>47. A game of pool was beginning,
and the room was full of men.
Holden entered, eager to get to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
light and the company of his fellows,
singing at the top of his voice:</p>

<p class="small1">“‘In Baltimore a-walking, a lady I did meet!’”</p>

<p>48. “Did you?” said the club-secretary
from his corner. “Did she
happen to tell you that your boots
were wringing wet? Great goodness,
man, it’s blood!”</p>

<p>49. “Bosh!” said Holden, picking
his cue from the rack. “May I cut
in? It’s dew. I’ve been riding
through high crops. My faith, my
boots are in a mess, though!”</p>

<p>50.</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw25">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="small1">“‘And if it be a girl she shall wear a wedding-ring,<br />
And if it be a boy he shall fight for his king,<br />
With his dirk, and his cap, and his little jacket blue,<br />
He shall walk the quarter-deck&mdash;’”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>51. “Yellow on blue&mdash;green next
player,” said the marker monotonously.</p>

<p>52. “<em>He shall walk the quarter-deck</em>'&mdash;Am
I green, marker?&mdash;<em>He
shall walk the quarter-deck</em>'&mdash;eh!
that's a bad shot&mdash;‘<em>As his daddy
used to do</em>!’”</p>

<p>53. “I don’t see that you have anything
to crow about,” said a zealous
junior civilian acidly. “The Government
is not exactly pleased with your
work when you relieved Sanders.”</p>

<p>54. “Does that mean a wigging
from headquarters?” said Holden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
with an abstracted smile. “I think
I can stand it.”</p>

<p>55. The talk beat up round the
ever-fresh subject of each man’s
work, and steadied Holden till it was
time to go to his dark empty bungalow,
where his butler received him
as one who knew all his affairs.
Holden remained awake for the
greater part of the night, and his
dreams were pleasant ones.</p>


<p class="center p2">II</p>

<p>56. “How old is he now?”</p>

<p>57. “<em>Ya illah!</em> What a man’s
question! He is all but six weeks
old; and on this night I go up to
the housetop with thee, my life, to
count the stars. For that is auspicious.
And he was born on a Friday
under the sign of the Sun, and it has
been told to me that he will outlive
us both and get wealth. Can we
wish for aught better, beloved?”</p>

<p>58. “There is nothing better. Let
us go up to the roof, and thou shalt
count the stars&mdash;but a few only, for
the sky is heavy with cloud.”</p>

<p>59. “The winter rains are late, and
maybe they come out of season.
Come, before all the stars are hid.
I have put on my richest jewels.”</p>

<p>60. “Thou hast forgotten the best
of all.”</p>

<p>61. “<em>Ai!</em> Ours. He comes also.
He has never yet seen the skies.”</p>

<p>62. Ameera climbed the narrow
staircase that led to the flat roof.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
The child, placid and unwinking, lay
in the hollow of her right arm, gorgeous
in silver-fringed muslin with a
small skull-cap on his head. Ameera
wore all that she valued most. The
diamond nose-stud that takes the
place of the Western patch in drawing
attention to the curve of the nostril,
the gold ornament in the centre
of the forehead studded with tallow-drop
emeralds and flawed rubies, the
heavy circlet of beaten gold that was
fastened round her neck by the softness
of the pure metal, and the
chinking curb-patterned silver anklets
hanging low over the rosy ankle-bone.
She was dressed in jade-green
muslin as befitted a daughter of the
Faith, and from shoulder to elbow
and elbow to wrist ran bracelets of
silver tied with floss silk, frail glass
bangles slipped over the wrist in
proof of the slenderness of the hand,
and certain heavy gold bracelets that
had no part in her country’s ornaments
but, since they were Holden’s
gift and fastened with a cunning
European snap, delighted her immensely.</p>

<p>63. They sat down by the low
white parapet of the roof, overlooking
the city and its lights.</p>

<p>64. “They are happy down there,”
said Ameera. “But I do not think
that they are as happy as we. Nor
do I think the white <em>mem-log</em> are as
happy. And thou?”</p>

<p>65. “I know they are not.”</p>

<p>66. “How dost thou know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>67. “They give their children over
to the nurses.”</p>

<p>“I have never seen that,” said
Ameera with a sigh, “nor do I wish
to see. <em>Ahi!</em>”&mdash;she dropped her
head on Holden’s shoulder&mdash;“I have
counted forty stars, and I am tired.
Look at the child, love of my life,
he is counting too.”</p>

<p>68. The baby was staring with
round eyes at the dark of the heavens.
Ameera placed him in Holden’s arms,
and he lay there without a cry.</p>

<p>69. “What shall we call him among
ourselves?” she said. “Look! Art
thou ever tired of looking? He carries
thy very eyes. But the mouth&mdash;”</p>

<p>70. “Is thine, most dear. Who
should know better than I?”</p>

<p>71. “’Tis such a feeble mouth. Oh,
so small! And yet it holds my heart
between its lips. Give him to me
now. He has been too long away.”</p>

<p>72. “Nay, let him lie; he has not
yet begun to cry.”</p>

<p>73. “When he cries thou wilt give
him back&mdash;eh? What a man of
mankind thou art! If he cried he
were only the dearer to me. But, my
life, what little name shall we give
him?”</p>

<p>74. The small body lay close to
Holden’s heart. It was utterly helpless
and very soft. He scarcely dared
to breathe for fear of crushing it.
The caged green parrot that is regarded
as a sort of guardian spirit in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
most native households moved on its
perch and fluttered a drowsy wing.</p>

<p>75. “There is the answer,” said
Holden. “Mian Mittu has spoken.
He shall be the parrot. When he is
ready he will talk mightily and run
about. Mian Mittu is the parrot in
thy&mdash;in the Mussulman tongue, is it
not?”</p>

<p>76. “Why put me so far off?” said
Ameera fretfully. “Let it be like
unto some English name&mdash;but not
wholly. For he is mine.”</p>

<p>77. “Then call him Tota, for that
is likest English.”</p>

<p>78. “Ay, Tota, and that is still the
parrot. Forgive me, my lord, for a
minute ago, but in truth he is too
little to wear all the weight of Mian
Mittu for name. He shall be Tota&mdash;our
Tota to us. Hearest thou, O
small one? Littlest, thou art Tota.”
She touched the child’s cheek, and he
waking, wailed, and it was necessary
to return him to his mother, who
soothed him with the wonderful
rhyme of “<em>Aré koko, Jaré koko!</em>”
which says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw30 p11">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="small1">“Oh, crow! Go crow! Baby’s sleeping sound,<br />
And the wild plums grow in the jungle, only a penny a pound,<br />
Only a penny a pound, <em>baba</em>, only a penny a pound.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>79. Reassured many times as to
the price of those plums, Tota cuddled
himself down to sleep. The two
sleek, white well-bullocks in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
courtyard were steadily chewing the
cud of their evening meal; old Pir
Khan squatted at the head of Holden’s
horse, his police sabre across
his knees, pulling drowsily at a big
water-pipe that croaked like a bull-frog
in a pond. Ameera’s mother sat
spinning in the lower veranda, and
the wooden gate was shut and barred.
The music of a marriage-procession
came to the roof above the gentle
hum of the city, and a string of flying-foxes
crossed the face of the low
moon.</p>

<p>80. “I have prayed,” said Ameera,
after a long pause, “I have prayed
for two things. First that I may die
in thy stead if thy death is demanded,
and in the second that I may die
in the place of the child. I have
prayed to the Prophet and to Beebee
Miriam [the Virgin Mary]. Thinkest
thou either will hear?”</p>

<p>81. “From thy lips who would not
hear the lightest word?”</p>

<p>82. “I asked for straight talk, and
thou hast given me sweet talk. Will
my prayers be heard?”</p>

<p>83. “How can I say? God is very
good.”</p>

<p>84. “Of that I am not sure. Listen
now. When I die, or the child
dies, what is thy fate? Living, thou
wilt return to the bold white <em>mem-log</em>,
for kind calls to kind.”</p>

<p>85. “Not always.”</p>

<p>86. “With a woman, no; with a
man it is otherwise. Thou wilt in
this life, later on, go back to thine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
own folk. That I could almost endure
for I should be dead. But in
thy very death thou wilt be taken
away to a strange place and a paradise
that I do not know.”</p>

<p>87. “Will it be paradise?”</p>

<p>88. “Surely, for who would harm
thee? But we two&mdash;I and the child&mdash;shall
be elsewhere, and we cannot
come to thee, nor canst thou come
to us. In the old days, before the
child was born, I did not think of
these things; but now I think of
them always. It is very hard talk.”</p>

<p>89. “It will fall as it will fall. To-morrow
we do not know, but to-day
and love we know well. Surely we
are happy now.”</p>

<p>90. “So happy that it were well to
make our happiness assured. And
thy Beebee Miriam should listen to
me; for she is also a woman. But
then she would envy me! It is not
seemly for men to worship a woman.”</p>

<p>91. Holden laughed aloud at Ameera’s
little spasm of jealousy.</p>

<p>92. “Is it not seemly? Why didst
thou not turn me from worship of
thee, then?”</p>

<p>93. “Thou a worshipper! And of
me? My king, for all thy sweet
words, well I know that I am thy
servant and thy slave, and the dust
under thy feet. And I would not
have it otherwise. See!”</p>

<p>94. Before Holden could prevent
her she stooped and touched
his feet; recovering herself with a
little laugh she hugged Tota close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
her bosom. Then, almost savagely:</p>

<p>95. “Is it true that the bold white
<em>mem-log</em> live for three times the
length of my life? Is it true that
they make their marriages not before
they are old women?”</p>

<p>96. “They marry as do others&mdash;when
they are women.”</p>

<p>97. “That I know, but they wed
when they are twenty-five. Is that
true?”</p>

<p>98. “That is true.”</p>

<p>99. “<em>Ya illah!</em> At twenty-five!
Who would of his own will take a
wife even of eighteen? She is a
woman&mdash;aging every hour. Twenty-five!
I shall be an old woman at
that age, and&mdash;those <em>mem-log</em> remain
young forever. How I hate
them!”</p>

<p>100. “What have they to do with
us?”</p>

<p>101. “I cannot tell. I know only
that there may now be alive on this
earth a woman ten years older than
I who may come to thee and take thy
love ten years after I am an old
woman, gray-headed, and the nurse
of Tota’s son. That is unjust and
evil. They should die too.”</p>

<p>102. “Now, for all thy years thou
art a child, and shalt be picked up
and carried down the staircase.”</p>

<p>103. “Tota! Have a care for
Tota, my lord! Thou at least art as
foolish as any babe!” Ameera tucked
Tota out of harm’s way in the hollow
of her neck, and was carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
downstairs laughing in Holden’s
arms, while Tota opened his eyes and
smiled after the manner of the lesser
angels.</p>

<p>104. He was a silent infant, and almost
before Holden could realise that
he was in the world, developed into
a small gold-coloured little god and
unquestioned despot of the house
overlooking the city. Those were
months of absolute happiness to
Holden and Ameera&mdash;happiness
withdrawn from the world, shut in
behind the wooden gate that Pir
Khan guarded. By day Holden did
his work with an immense pity for
such as were not so fortunate as
himself, and a sympathy for small
children that amazed and amused
many mothers at the little station
gatherings. At nightfall he returned
to Ameera&mdash;Ameera, full of the
wondrous doings of Tota; how he
had been seen to clap his hands together
and move his fingers with intention
and purpose&mdash;which was
manifestly a miracle; how, later, he
had of his own initiative crawled out
of his low bedstead on to the floor
and swayed on both feet for the
space of three breaths.</p>

<p>105. “And they were long breaths,
for my heart stood still with delight,”
said Ameera.</p>

<p>106. Then Tota took the beasts into
his councils&mdash;the well-bullocks, the
little gray squirrels, the mongoose
that lived in a hole near the well,
and especially Mian Mittu, the parrot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
whose tail he grievously pulled,
and Mian Mittu screamed till Ameera
and Holden arrived.</p>

<p>107. “O villain! Child of strength!
This to thy brother on the housetop!
<em>Tobah, tobah!</em> Fie! Fie! But I
know a charm to make him wise as
Suleiman and Aflatoun [Solomon and
Plato]. Now look,” said Ameera.
She drew from an embroidered bag a
handful of almonds. “See! we
count seven. In the name of God!”</p>

<p>108. She placed Mian Mittu, very
angry and rumpled, on the top of his
cage, and seating herself between the
babe and the bird she cracked and
peeled an almond less white than her
teeth. “This is a true charm, my
life, and do not laugh. See! I give
the parrot one half and Tota the
other.” Mian Mittu with careful
beak took his share from between
Ameera’s lips, and she kissed the
other half into the mouth of the
child, who ate it slowly with wondering
eyes. “This I will do each day
of seven, and without doubt he who
is ours will be a bold speaker and
wise. Eh, Tota, what wilt thou be
when thou art a man and I am
gray-headed?” Tota tucked his fat
legs into adorable creases. He
could crawl, but he was not going
to waste the spring of his youth in
idle speech. He wanted Mian
Mittu’s tail to tweak.</p>

<p>109. When he was advanced to the
dignity of a silver belt&mdash;which, with
a magic square engraved on silver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
and hung round his neck, made up
the greater part of his clothing&mdash;he
staggered on a perilous journey
down the garden to Pir Khan and
proffered him all his jewels in exchange
for one little ride on Holden’s
horse, having seen his mother’s
mother chaffering with peddlers in
the veranda. Pir Khan wept and set
the untried feet on his own gray
head in sign of fealty, and brought
the bold adventurer to his mother’s
arms, vowing that Tota would be a
leader of men ere his beard was
grown.</p>

<p>110. One hot evening, while he sat
on the roof between his father and
mother watching the never-ending
warfare of the kites that the city boys
flew, he demanded a kite of his own
with Pir Khan to fly it, because he
had a fear of dealing with anything
larger than himself, and when Holden
called him a “spark” he rose to
his feet and answered slowly in defence
of his new-found individuality:
<em>“Hum 'park nahin hai. Hum admi
hai</em> [I am no spark, but a man].”</p>

<p>111. The protest made Holden
choke and devote himself very seriously
to a consideration of Tota’s
future. He need hardly have taken
the trouble. The delight of that life
was too perfect to endure. Therefore
it was taken away as many
things are taken away in India&mdash;suddenly
and without warning. The
little lord of the house, as Pir Khan
called him, grew sorrowful and complained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
of pains who had never
known the meaning of pain. Ameera,
wild with terror, watched him
through the night, and in the dawning
of the second day the life was
shaken out of him by fever&mdash;the
seasonal autumn fever. It seemed
altogether impossible that he could
die, and neither Ameera nor Holden
at first believed the evidence of the
little body on the bedstead. Then
Ameera beat her head against the
wall and would have flung herself
down the well in the garden had
Holden not restrained her by main
force.</p>

<p>112. One mercy only was granted
to Holden. He rode to his office in
broad daylight and found waiting
him an unusually heavy mail that
demanded concentrated attention and
hard work. He was not, however,
alive to this kindness of the gods.</p>


<p class="center p2">III</p>

<p>113. The first shock of a bullet is
no more than a brisk pinch. The
wrecked body does not send in its
protest to the soul till ten or fifteen
seconds later. Holden realised his
pain slowly, exactly as he had realised
his happiness, and with the same
imperious necessity for hiding all
traces of it. In the beginning he only
felt that there had been a loss, and
that Ameera needed comforting
where she sat with her head on her
knees shivering as Mian Mittu from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
the housetop called: <em>Tota! Tota!
Tota!</em> Later, all his world and the
daily life of it rose up to hurt him.
It was an outrage that any one of the
children at the band-stand in the
evening should be alive and clamorous,
when his own child lay dead. It
was more than mere pain when one of
them touched him, and stories told by
over-fond fathers of their children’s
latest performances cut him to the
quick. He could not declare his pain.
He had neither help, comfort, nor
sympathy; and Ameera at the end of
each weary day would lead him
through the hell of self-questioning
reproach which is reserved for those
who have lost a child, and believe
that with a little&mdash;just a little&mdash;more
care it might have been saved.</p>

<p>114. “Perhaps,” Ameera would
say, “I did not take sufficient heed.
Did I, or did I not? The sun on the
roof that day when he played so long
alone and I was&mdash;ahi! braiding my
hair&mdash;it may be that the sun then
bred the fever. If I had warned him
from the sun he might have lived.
But oh, my life, say that I am guiltless!
Thou knowest that I loved him
as I love thee. Say that there is no
blame on me, or I shall die&mdash;I shall
die!”</p>

<p>115. “There is no blame&mdash;before
God, none. It was written, and how
could we do aught to save? What
has been, has been. Let it go, beloved.”</p>

<p>116. “He was all my heart to me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
How can I let the thought go when
my arm tells me every night that he
is not here? <em>Ahi! Ahi!</em> O Tota,
come back to me&mdash;come back again,
and let us be all together as it was
before!”</p>

<p>117. “Peace, peace! For thine own
sake, and for mine also, if thou lovest
me&mdash;rest.”</p>

<p>118. “By this I know thou dost
not care; and how shouldst thou?
The white men have hearts of stone
and souls of iron. Oh, that I had
married a man of mine own people&mdash;though
he beat me&mdash;and had
never eaten the bread of an alien!”</p>

<p>119. “Am I an alien&mdash;mother of
my son?”</p>

<p>120. “What else&mdash;<em>sahib</em>?... Oh,
forgive me&mdash;forgive! The death
has driven me mad. Thou art the
life of my heart, and the light of
my eyes, and the breath of my life,
and&mdash;and I have put thee from me,
though it was but for a moment. If
thou goest away, to whom shall I
look for help? Do not be angry. Indeed,
it was the pain that spoke and
not thy slave.”</p>

<p>121. “I know, I know. We be
two who were three. The greater
need therefore that we should be
one.”</p>

<p>122. They were sitting on the roof
as of custom. The night was a warm
one in early spring, and sheet-lightning
was dancing on the horizon
to a broken tune played by far-off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
thunder. Ameera settled herself in
Holden’s arms.</p>

<p>123. “The dry earth is lowing like
a cow for the rain, and I&mdash;I am
afraid. It was not like this when we
counted the stars. But thou lovest
me as much as before, though a bond
is taken away? Answer!”</p>

<p>124. “I love more because a new
bond has come out of the sorrow that
we have eaten together, and that
thou knowest.”</p>

<p>125. “Yea, I knew,” said Ameera
in a very small whisper. “But it is
good to hear thee say so, my life,
who art so strong to help. I will
be a child no more but a woman and
an aid to thee. Listen! Give me
my <em>sitar</em> and I will sing bravely.”</p>

<p>126. She took the light silver-studded
<em>sitar</em> and began a song of the
great hero Rajah Rasalu. The hand
failed on the strings, the tune halted,
checked, and at a low note turned off
to the poor little nursery-rhyme
about the wicked crow:</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw30 p11">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="small1">
“‘And the wild plums grow in the jungle, only a penny a pound,<br />
Only a penny a pound, <em>baba</em>&mdash;only....’”</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>127. Then came the tears and the
piteous rebellion against fate till she
slept, moaning a little in her sleep,
with the right arm thrown clear of
the body as though it protected something
that was not there. It was
after this night that life became a
little easier for Holden. The ever-present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
pain of loss drove him into
his work, and the work repaid him
by filling up his mind for nine or ten
hours a day. Ameera sat alone in
the house and brooded, but grew
happier when she understood that
Holden was more at ease, according
to the custom of women. They
touched happiness again, but this
time with caution.</p>

<p>128. “It was because we loved
Tota that he died. The jealousy of
God was upon us,” said Ameera. “I
have hung up a large black jar before
our window to turn the evil eye from
us, and we must make no protestations
of delight, but go softly underneath
the stars, lest God find us out.
Is that not good talk, worthless
one?”</p>

<p>129. She had shifted the accent on
the word that means “beloved,” in
proof of the sincerity of her purpose.
But the kiss that followed the new
christening was a thing that any deity
might have envied. They went
about henceforward saying: “It is
naught, it is naught”; and hoping
that all the Powers heard.</p>

<p>130. The Powers were busy on
other things. They had allowed
thirty million people four years of
plenty wherein men fed well and the
crops were certain, and the birth-rate
rose year by year; the districts
reported a purely agricultural population
varying from nine hundred to
two thousand to the square mile of
the overburdened earth; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
Member for Lower Tooting, wandering
about India in pot-hat and frock-coat,
talked largely of the benefits
of British rule and suggested as the
one thing needful the establishment
of a duly qualified electoral system
and a general bestowal of the franchise.
His long-suffering hosts smiled
and made him welcome, and when
he paused to admire, with pretty
picked words, the blossom of the
blood-red dhak-tree that had flowered
untimely for a sign of what was
coming, they smiled more than ever.</p>

<p>131. It was the Deputy Commissioner
of Kot-Kumharsen, staying at
the club for a day, who lightly told
a tale that made Holden’s blood run
cold as he overheard the end.</p>

<p>132. “He won’t bother any one
any more. Never saw a man so
astonished in my life. By Jove, I
thought he meant to ask a question
in the House about it. Fellow passenger
in his ship&mdash;dined next him&mdash;bowled
over by cholera and died
in eighteen hours. You needn’t
laugh, you fellows. The Member for
Lower Tooting is awfully angry
about it; but he’s more scared. I
think he’s going to take his enlightened
self out of India.”</p>

<p>133. “I’d give a good deal if he
were knocked over. It might keep
a few vestrymen of his kidney to
their own parish. But what’s this
about cholera? It’s full early for
anything of that kind,” said the warden
of an unprofitable salt-lick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>134. “Don’t know,” said the Deputy
Commissioner reflectively. “We’ve
got locusts with us. There’s sporadic
cholera all along the north&mdash;at least
we’re calling it sporadic for decency’s
sake. The spring crops are
short in five districts, and nobody
seems to know where the rains are.
It’s nearly March now. I don’t want
to scare anybody, but it seems to me
that Nature’s going to audit her accounts
with a big red pencil this
summer.”</p>

<p>135. “Just when I wanted to take
leave, too!” said a voice across the
room.</p>

<p>136. “There won’t be much leave
this year, but there ought to be a
great deal of promotion. I’ve come
in to persuade the Government to
put my pet canal on the list of
famine-relief works. It’s an ill
wind that blows no good. I shall
get that canal finished at last.”</p>

<p>137. “Is it the old programme
then,” said Holden; “famine, fever,
and cholera?”</p>

<p>138. “Oh, no. Only local scarcity
and an unusual prevalence of seasonal
sickness. You’ll find it all in
the reports if you live till next year.
You’re a lucky chap. <em>You</em> haven’t got
a wife to send out of harm’s way.
The hill stations ought to be full of
women this year.”</p>

<p>139. “I think you’re inclined to exaggerate
the talk in the <em>bazars</em>,” said
a young civilian in the secretariat.
“Now I have observed&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>140. “I daresay you have,” said
the Deputy Commissioner, “but
you’ve a great deal more to observe,
my son. In the meantime, I wish to
observe to you&mdash;” and he drew him
aside to discuss the construction of
the canal that was so dear to his
heart. Holden went to his bungalow
and began to understand that he was
not alone in the world, and also that
he was afraid for the sake of another&mdash;which
is the most soul-satisfying
fear known to man.</p>

<p>141. Two months later, as the
Deputy had foretold, Nature began to
audit her accounts with a red pencil.
On the heels of the spring reapings
came a cry for bread, and the Government,
which had decreed that no
man should die of want, sent wheat.
Then came the cholera from all four
quarters of the compass. It struck
a pilgrim-gathering of half a million
at a sacred shrine. Many died at
the feet of their god; the others
broke and ran over the face of the
land carrying the pestilence with
them. It smote a walled city and
killed two hundred a day. The people
crowded the trains, hanging on
to the foot-boards and squatting on
the roofs of the carriages, and the
cholera followed them, for at each
station they dragged out the dead
and the dying. They died by the
roadside, and the horses of the Englishmen
shied at the corpses in the
grass. The rains did not come, and
the earth turned to iron lest man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
should escape death by hiding in her.
The English sent their wives away to
the hills and went about their work,
coming forward as they were bidden
to fill the gaps in the fighting-line.
Holden, sick with fear of losing his
chiefest treasure on earth, had done
his best to persuade Ameera to go
away with her mother to the Himalayas.</p>

<p>142. “Why should I go?” said she
one evening on the roof.</p>

<p>143. “There is sickness, and people
are dying, and all the white <em>mem-log</em>
have gone.”</p>

<p>144. “All of them?”</p>

<p>145. “All&mdash;unless perhaps there
remain some old scald-head who
vexes her husband’s heart by running
risk of death.”</p>

<p>146. “Nay; who stays is my sister,
and thou must not abuse her, for I
will be a scald-head too. I am glad
all the bold <em>mem-log</em> are gone.”</p>

<p>147. “Do I speak to a woman, or a
babe? Go to the hills and I will see
to it that thou goest like a queen’s
daughter. Think, child. In a red-lacquered
bullock-cart, veiled and curtained,
with brass peacocks upon the
pole and red cloth hangings. I will
send two orderlies for guard, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>148. “Peace! Thou art the babe in
speaking thus. What use are those
toys to me? <em>He</em> would have patted
the bullocks and played with the
housings. For his sake, perhaps&mdash;thou
hast made me very English&mdash;I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
might have gone. Now, I will not.
Let the <em>mem-log</em> run.”</p>

<p>149. “Their husbands are sending
them, beloved.”</p>

<p>150. “Very good talk. Since when
hast thou been my husband to tell me
what to do? I have but borne thee
a son. Thou art only all the desire of
my soul to me. How shall I depart
when I know that if evil befall thee
by the breadth of so much as my
littlest finger-nail&mdash;is that not
small?&mdash;I should be aware of it
though I were in paradise. And
here, this summer thou mayest die&mdash;<em>ai,
janee</em>, die! and in dying they
might call to tend thee a white
woman, and she would rob me in
the last of thy love!”</p>

<p>151. “But love is not born in a moment
or on a death-bed!”</p>

<p>152. “What dost thou know of
love, stone-heart? She would take
thy thanks at least and, by God and
the Prophet and Beebee Miriam
the mother of thy Prophet, that I
will never endure. My lord and my
love, let there be no more foolish
talk of going away. Where thou
art, I am. It is enough.” She put
an arm round his neck and a hand on
his mouth.</p>

<p>153. There are not many happinesses
so complete as those that are
snatched under the shadow of the
sword. They sat together and
laughed, calling each other openly
by every pet name that could move
the wrath of the gods. The city below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
them was locked up in its own
torments. Sulphur fires blazed in the
streets; the conches in the Hindu
temples screamed and bellowed, for
the gods were inattentive in those
days. There was a service in the
great Mohammedan shrine, and the
call to prayer from the minarets was
almost unceasing. They heard the
wailing in the houses of the dead,
and once the shriek of a mother
who had lost a child and was calling
for its return. In the gray
dawn they saw the dead borne out
through the city gates, each litter
with its own little knot of mourners.
Wherefore they kissed each
other and shivered.</p>

<p>154. It was a red and heavy audit,
for the land was very sick and
needed a little breathing space ere
the torrent of cheap life should flood
it anew. The children of immature
fathers and undeveloped mothers
made no resistance. They were
cowed and sat still, waiting till the
sword should be sheathed in November
if it were so willed. There
were gaps among the English, but
the gaps were filled. The work of
superintending famine-relief, cholera-sheds,
medicine-distribution, and
what little sanitation was possible,
went forward because it was so ordered.</p>

<p>155. Holden had been told to keep
himself in readiness to move to replace
the next man who should fall.
There were twelve hours in each day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
when he could not see Ameera, and
she might die in three. He was
considering what his pain would be
if he could not see her for three
months, or if she died out of his
sight. He was absolutely certain
that her death would be demanded&mdash;so
certain that when he looked up
from the telegram and saw Pir Khan
breathless in the doorway, he
laughed aloud. “And?” said he&mdash;</p>

<p>156. “When there is a cry in the
night and the spirit flutters into the
throat, who has a charm that will restore?
Come swiftly, heaven-born!
It is the black cholera.”</p>

<p>157. Holden galloped to his home.
The sky was heavy with clouds, for
the long-deferred rains were near
and the heat was stifling. Ameera’s
mother met him in the courtyard,
whimpering: “She is dying. She is
nursing herself into death. She is
all but dead. What shall I do, <em>sahib</em>?”</p>

<p>158. Ameera was lying in the room
in which Tota had been born. She
made no sign when Holden entered,
because the human soul is a very
lonely thing and, when it is getting
ready to go away, hides itself in a
misty border-land where the living
may not follow. The black cholera
does its work quietly and without explanation.
Ameera was being thrust
out of life as though the Angel of
Death had himself put his hand
upon her. The quick breathing
seemed to show that she was either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
afraid or in pain, but neither eyes
nor mouth gave any answer to Holden’s
kisses. There was nothing to be
said or done. Holden could only
wait and suffer. The first drops of
the rain began to fall on the roof,
and he could hear shouts of joy in
the parched city.</p>

<p>159. The soul came back a little
and the lips moved. Holden bent
down to listen. “Keep nothing of
mine,” said Ameera. “Take no hair
from my head. <em>She</em> would make
thee burn it later on. That flame I
should feel. Lower! Stoop lower!
Remember only that I was thine
and bore thee a son. Though thou
wed a white woman to-morrow, the
pleasure of receiving in thy arms
thy first son is taken from thee forever.
Remember me when thy son
is born&mdash;the one that shall carry
thy name before all men. His misfortunes
be on my head. I bear witness&mdash;I
bear witness”&mdash;the lips
were forming the words on his ear&mdash;“that
there is no God but&mdash;thee,
beloved!”</p>

<p>160. Then she died. Holden sat
still, and all thought was taken from
him&mdash;till he heard Ameera’s mother
lift the curtain.</p>

<p>161. “Is she dead, <em>sahib</em>?”</p>

<p>162. “She is dead.”</p>

<p>163. “Then I will mourn, and
afterwards take an inventory of the
furniture in this house. For that will
be mine. The <em>sahib</em> does not mean to
resume it? It is so little, so very little,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
<em>sahib</em>, and I am an old woman.
I would like to lie softly.”</p>

<p>164. “For the mercy of God be silent
a while. Go out and mourn
where I cannot hear.”</p>

<p>165. “<em>Sahib</em>, she will be buried in
four hours.”</p>

<p>166. “I know the custom. I shall
go ere she is taken away. That matter
is in thy hands. Look to it, that
the bed on which&mdash;on which she
lies&mdash;”</p>

<p>167. “Aha! That beautiful red-lacquered
bed. I have long desired&mdash;”</p>

<p>168. “That the bed is left here untouched
for my disposal. All else
in the house is thine. Hire a cart,
take everything, go hence, and before
sunrise let there be nothing in
this house but that which I have ordered
thee to respect.”</p>

<p>169. “I am an old woman. I
would stay at least for the days of
mourning and the rains have just
broken. Whither shall I go?”</p>

<p>170. “What is that to me? My order
is that there is a going. The
house-gear is worth a thousand rupees,
and my orderly shall bring thee
a hundred rupees to-night.”</p>

<p>171. “That is very little. Think of
the cart-hire.”</p>

<p>172. “It shall be nothing unless
thou goest, and with speed. O
woman, get hence and leave me with
my dead!”</p>

<p>173. The mother shuffled down the
staircase, and in her anxiety to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
stock of the house-fittings forgot to
mourn. Holden stayed by Ameera’s
side and the rain roared on the roof.
He could not think connectedly by
reason of the noise, though he made
many attempts to do so. Then four
sheeted ghosts glided dripping into
the room and stared at him through
their veils. They were the washers
of the dead. Holden left the room
and went out to his horse. He had
come in a dead, stifling calm
through ankle-deep dust. He found
the courtyard a rain-lashed pond
alive with frogs; a torrent of yellow
water ran under the gate, and a roaring
wind drove the bolts of the rain
like buckshot against the mud walls.
Pir Khan was shivering in his little
hut by the gate, and the horse was
stamping uneasily in the water.</p>

<p>174. “I have been told the <em>sahib’s</em>
order,” said Pir Khan. “It is well.
This house is now desolate. I go
also, or my monkey face would be a
reminder of that which has been.
Concerning the bed, I will bring
that to thy house yonder in the morning;
but remember, <em>sahib</em>, it will be
to thee a knife turning in a green
wound. I go upon a pilgrimage, and
I will take no money. I have grown
fat in the protection of the Presence
whose sorrow is my sorrow. For the
last time I hold his stirrup.”</p>

<p>175. He touched Holden’s foot
with both hands, and the horse sprang
out into the road, where the creaking
bamboos were whipping the sky and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
all the frogs were chuckling. Holden
could not see for the rain in his
face. He put his hands before his
eyes and muttered:</p>

<p>176. “Oh, you brute! You utter
brute!”</p>

<p>177. The news of his trouble was
already in his bungalow. He read
the knowledge in his butler’s eyes
when Ahmed Khan brought in food,
and for the first and last time in his
life laid a hand upon his master’s
shoulder, saying: “Eat, <em>sahib</em>, eat.
Meat is good against sorrow. I also
have known. Moreover the shadows
come and go, <em>sahib</em>; the shadows
come and go. These be curried
eggs.”</p>

<p>178. Holden could neither eat nor
sleep. The heavens sent down
eight inches of rain in that night and
washed the earth clean. The waters
tore down walls, broke roads, and
scoured open the shallow graves on
the Mohammedan burying-ground.
All next day it rained, and Holden
sat still in his house considering his
sorrow. On the morning of the
third day he received a telegram
which said only: “Ricketts, Myndonie.
Dying. Holden relieve. Immediate.”
Then he thought that before
he had departed he would look
at the house wherein he had been
master and lord. There was a break
in the weather, and the rank earth
steamed with vapour.</p>

<p>179. He found that the rains had
torn down the mud pillars of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
gateway, and the heavy wooden gate
that had guarded his life hung lazily
from one hinge. There was grass
three inches high in the courtyard;
Pir Khan’s lodge was empty, and
the sodden thatch sagged between the
beams. A gray squirrel was in possession
of the veranda, as if the
house had been untenanted for thirty
years instead of three days.
Ameera’s mother had removed everything
except some mildewed matting.
The <em>tick-tick</em> of the little scorpions
as they hurried across the floor was
the only sound in the house.
Ameera’s room and the other one
where Tota had lived were heavy
with mildew; and the narrow staircase
leading to the roof was streaked
and stained with rain-borne mud.
Holden saw all these things, and
came out again to meet in the road
Durga Dass, his landlord&mdash;portly,
affable, clothed in white muslin, and
driving a C-spring buggy. He was
overlooking his property to see how
the roofs stood the stress of the first
rains.</p>

<p>180. “I have heard,” said he, “you
will not take this place any more,
<em>sahib</em>?”</p>

<p>181. “What are you going to do
with it?”</p>

<p>182. “Perhaps I shall let it again.”</p>

<p>183. “Then I will keep it on while
I am away.”</p>

<p>184. Durga Dass was silent for
some time. “You shall not take it
on, <em>sahib</em>,” he said. “When I was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
young man I also&mdash;But to-day I
am a member of the Municipality.
Ho! Ho! No. When the birds
have gone, what need to keep the
nest? I will have it pulled down&mdash;the
timber will sell for something
always. It shall be pulled down,
and the Municipality shall make a
road across as they desire, from the
burning-ghaut to the city wall, so
that no man may say where this
house stood.”</p>

<p>Sydney Smith uses this word [humor] to cover any thing that
is ridiculous and laughable. So the epithet <em>comic</em> is quite indiscriminately
applied. But we ought not to submit to this loose
application; for there are plenty of other words to make proper
distinctions for us amid our pleasurable moods, and permit us to
reserve humor for something which is neither punning, wit,
satire, nor comedy. Humor may avail itself of all these mental
exercises, but only as a manager casts his stock company to set
forth the prevailing spirit of a play. Comedy, for instance, represents
sorrows, passions, and annoyances, but shows them without
the sombre purpose of tragedy to enforce a supreme will at
any cost. All our weaknesses threaten in comedy to result in
serious embarrassments, but there is such inexhaustible material
for laughter in the whims and follies with which we baffle ourselves
and others, that the tragic threat is collared just in time
and shaken into pleasure. All kinds of details of our life are
represented, which tragedy could never tolerate in its main drift
towards the pathos of defeated human wills and broken hearts.
Tricks, vices, fatuities, crotchets, vanities, play their game for a
stake no higher than the mirth of outwitting each other; and
they all pay penalties of a light kind which God exacts smilingly
for the sake of keeping our disorders at a minimum. Comedy
also finds a great deal of its charm in the unconsciousness of
an infirmity. We exhibit ourselves unawares: each one is perfectly
understood by everybody but himself; so we plot and
vapor through an intrigue with placards on each back, where all
but the wearers can indulge their mirth at seeing us parading so
innocently with advertisements of our price and quality.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John

<h3>HUMOROUS STORIES</h3>
</div>


<p>There are as many kinds of humorous stories as there
are kinds of humor, ranging from gentle mirth, comedy,
fun, and farce, to burlesque, ridicule, satire and irony.
Some stories are typically humorous in their central situation,
as Mark Twain’s “The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County”;
others abound in a whole series of funny situations,
as “The King of Boyville,” by William Allen
White; others, again, are rich in the humorous sayings by
the writer, rather than revealed in humorous plot, as in
Artemus Ward’s sketch, “Horace Greeley’s Ride to
Placerville”; still others put the humor into the speech
of the characters, as in “The Phonograph and the Graft,”
by O. Henry; while yet others exhibit two or more of
the foregoing kinds, and are by turns gay, or whimsical,
or satirical, as the characters and happenings may permit,
mingling humor of plot with mirth of word and incident.</p>

<p>The two chief ingredients of humor&mdash;though for the
most part it defies analysis&mdash;are surprise, and a feeling of
incongruity. But these must be accompanied by no higher
emotion. It would surprise us to meet the incongruous
sight of a half-clad child struggling in the snow, but the
vision would not be humorous&mdash;the higher emotion of
pity would preclude that. But to see an arrogant fop
stripped of his finery and floundering and spluttering in
a snow drift into which he had been tossed, <em>would</em> be
funny&mdash;to others.</p>

<p>Merely for a story to possess humor would not warrant
our classing it as a humorous story, for humor is a
sunny ray gleaming often through literature and life, but
when the typical spirit and prevailing treatment of the
story are humorous, it may properly be so entitled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<h3>HENRY AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>William Sidney Porter, otherwise known as “O.
Henry,” was born in 1867, in Greensboro, N. C.&mdash;the
descendant of several governors of that state, it may be
remarked in passing. While still very young he went to
Texas and received his education at an academy there.
Because of poor health he was unable to attend college,
so he spent two and a half years of his early manhood
on a cattle ranch. Following that period came his journalistic
work on the Houston <em>Post</em>, and a little ten-page
weekly story-paper of his own, <em>The Iconoclast</em>&mdash;afterwards
renamed <em>The Rolling Stone</em>&mdash;most of the stories
for which he wrote himself. After several years in
Houston, he visited Central America with a friend&mdash;a
trip which, later, yielded rich material for his first book.
Then followed a short period as a drug clerk in Austin,
Texas. Next we see him in New Orleans, again embarked
upon literary work; and there it was that he first
showed real promise as a short-story writer, and there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
also that he adopted his unique pseudonym&mdash;the surname
of which was selected at random from a newspaper
account of a social function, and the initial letter because
it was the “easiest letter written.” About eight years
before his death he came to New York, in response to an
offer from one of the magazine editors there, and after
that his name became well-known and his success assured.
He died in New York City, June 5, 1910, at the age of
forty-two. His three earliest books are perhaps the ones
by which he is best known; <em>Cabbages and Kings</em>, <em>The
Four Million</em>, and <em>The Trimmed Lamp</em>. Eleven volumes
of short-stories comprise his literary output. The later
stories do not enhance his reputation, though some of
them are in his best vein&mdash;notably “The Ransom of Red
Chief,” contained in the volume <em>Whirligigs</em>, published the
year of his death. His last book, <em>Sixes and Sevens</em>, was
issued posthumously, in 1911.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of all short-story writers O. Henry was easily first as
a master of surprise. The sudden and often astounding
reversals at the end of his stories became delightfully
characteristic, and the reader with the O. Henry habit
played a happy though always losing game with himself
in trying to forecast the denouement of each new story.
Sometimes the yarn-spinner would delight in leading us
to curl our lip, and say, “Pshaw, O. Henry is employing
a rather old device&mdash;in fact, this is quite trite&mdash;” and
then all in an instant the sly phrase would peep forth to
show that we had been caught from ambush; for O.
Henry had scant reverence for the reader’s dignity&mdash;he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
poked fun at him as laughingly as could Shakespeare himself,
on occasion.</p>

<p>No other writer ever made slang so really funny, yet
few knew better the richness of serious English diction
for really literary ends. Not that he embellished his
sentences, but that he appraised every word at its true
value before uttering it as literary coin. When he said
that one of his characters was “denounced by the name
of&mdash;&mdash;” (I have forgotten what), he extracted the full
essence from those six words, and that is art.</p>

<p>Other short-story writers have been as trenchant in
wit, others as keen in observation, but none has known
so wide a variety of common-folk as O. Henry. Four
great types he understood with rare completeness: the
Texan (<em>Heart of the West</em>), the Central American (<em>Cabbages
and Kings</em>), the middle-and lower-class New
Yorker (<em>The Four Million</em>),&mdash;and Everybody Else (<em>all
of his eleven books of short-stories</em>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>O. Henry’s advice to young writers as to the secret of short-story
writing is well known. “There are two rules,” he said.
“The first rule is to write stories that please yourself. There
is no second rule.” He was once facetiously asked if there were
a second rule, what that rule would be. “Sell the story,” he
answered.&mdash;<span class="smcap">G. J. Nathan</span>, <em>O. Henry in His Own Bagdad</em>. <em>The
Bookman</em>, vol. 31.</p>

<p>O. Henry has often been called “the Yankee Maupassant,” and
up to a certain point the characterization is suggestive. His
stories have the swiftness and point of the anecdote, as Maupassant’s
have. He employs just enough art to keep alive the reader’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
interest for the laugh or the gasp to which everything else
leads up.... As a humorist he was American to the finger tips.
That is to say, he secured his effects by over-statement, which is
the salient characteristic of American humor.... Mark Twain
was a world humorist; O. Henry was an American humorist.&mdash;<em>A
Typically American Short-Story Writer</em> (<em>Current Literature</em>,
vol. 49).</p>

<p>The author seems to know almost every type of man&mdash;the
rich and portly financier, the “fly” newsboy or district messenger,
the denizens of the great hotels, the “salesladies,” the
chorus girls, the women in the shop, the raffish hangers-on of the
saloons, the gamblers, and the grafters.... Mr. Porter is a real
<em>flâneur</em> of the American type, only, he confines himself to no
boulevard, to no city, to no state, nor even to a single country.
The world, in fact, is his oyster, and he has learned almost unconsciously
to open it and to extract from it alike the meat and
the salty juices.... He gets down to the very heart of things.
He sees the humour and the pathos blended; yet, on the whole,
he is an optimist ... who believes that in every human being
there is to be found something good, however mixed it may be
with other qualities; and, like a true American, he can see and
chuckle at the humour of it all.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Harry Thurston Peck</span>, <em>Some

<h3>THE RANSOM OF RED CHIEF<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></h3>

<p class="big05 center">BY O. HENRY</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span><br />
Setting and characters.<br />
A favorite form of humor with O. Henry.</div>

<p>It looked like a good thing; but
wait till I tell you. We were down
South, in Alabama&mdash;Bill Driscoll
and myself&mdash;when this kidnapping
idea struck us. It was, as Bill afterward
expressed it, “during a moment
of temporary mental apparition”;
but we didn’t find that out till later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Setting more specific.<br />
Satire of contrast&mdash;frequent
with author.</div>

<p>2. There was a town down there,
as flat as a flannel-cake, and called
Summit, of course. It contained inhabitants
of as undeleterious and
self-satisfied a class of peasantry as
ever clustered around a Maypole.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The narrator is not consistently
ungrammatical.</div>

<p>3. Bill and me had a joint capital
of about six hundred dollars, and
we needed just two thousand dollars
more to pull off a fraudulent town-lot
scheme in Western Illinois with.
We talked it over on the front steps
of the hotel. Philoprogenitiveness,
says we, is strong in semi-rural communities;
therefore, and for other
reasons, a kidnapping project ought <span class="sidenote">The introduction develops
the foundation of the
<span class="smcap">Plot Situation</span> gradually.</span>
to do better there than in the radius
of newspapers that send reporters
out in plain clothes to stir up talk
about such things. We know that
Summit couldn’t get after us with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>anything stronger than constables
and, maybe, some lackadaisical blood-hounds
and a diatribe or two in the
Weekly Farmers’ Budget. So, it
looked good.</p>


<div class="sidenote">The humor takes the form
of situation, diction, satire,
and sly little surprises
throughout.</div>

<p id="par4">4. We selected for our victim the
only child of a prominent citizen
named Ebenezer Dorset. The father
was respectable and tight, a mortgage
fancier and a stern, upright collection-plate
passer and forecloser.
The kid was a boy of ten, with bas-relief
freckles, and hair the color of
the cover of the magazine you buy
at the news-stand when you want to
catch a train. Bill and me figured
that Ebenezer would melt down for
a ransom of two thousand dollars to
a cent. But wait till I tell you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Setting for main action.</div>

<p>5. About two miles from Summit
was a little mountain, covered with
a dense cedar brake. On the rear
elevation of this mountain was a
cave. There we stored provisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Main Action Begins:
First Plot Incident.</span></div>

<p>6. One evening after sundown, we
drove in a buggy past old Dorset’s
house. The kid was in the street,
throwing rocks at the kitten on the
opposite fence.</p>

<p>7. “Hey, little boy!” says Bill,
“would you like to have a bag of
candy and a nice ride?”</p>


<p>8. The boy catches Bill neatly in
the eye with a piece of brick. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Contributory Incident.</span><br />
As a matter of technique,
note that contributory incidents
might be varied or
omitted without altering
the plot <em>essentially</em>. These
are not all specifically
noted in this story.</span></p>

<p>9. “That will cost the old man an
extra five hundred dollars,” says
Bill, climbing over the wheel.</p>

<p>10. That boy put up a fight like a
welterweight cinnamon bear; but, at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
last, we got him down in the bottom
of the buggy and drove away. We
took him up to the cave, and I hitched
the horse in the cedar brake. After
dark I drove the buggy to the little
village, three miles away, where we
had hired it, and walked back to the
mountain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Bill” and “the Kid”
serve as the contesting
characters.</div>

<p>11. Bill was pasting court-plaster
over the scratches and bruises on his
features. There was a fire burning
behind the big rock at the entrance
of the cave, and the boy was watching
a pot of boiling coffee, with two
buzzard tail-feathers stuck in his red
hair. He points a stick at me when
I come up, and says:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note title of the story.<br />
“Bill” never smiles.</div>

<p>12. “Ha! cursed paleface, do you
dare to enter the camp of Red Chief,
the terror of the plains?”</p>



<p>13. “He’s all right now,” says Bill,
rolling up his trousers and examining
some bruises on his shins.
“We’re playing Indian. We’re making
Buffalo Bill’s show look like
magic-lantern views of Palestine in
the town hall. <span class="sidenote">Note how the author uses
swift changes to humorous
effect.</span> I’m Old Hank, the
Trapper, Red Chief’s captive, and I’m
to be scalped at daybreak. By Geronimo!
that kid can kick hard.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Essential, or Plot, Situation.</span></div>
<p>14. Yes, sir, that kid seemed to be
having the time of his life. The fun
of camping out in a cave had made
him forget that he was a captive
himself. He immediately christened
me Snake-eye, the Spy, and announced
that, when his braves returned
from the warpath, I was to be broiled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
at the stake at the rising of the
sun.</p>

<p>15. Then we had supper; and he
filled his mouth full of bacon and
bread and gravy, and began to talk.
He made a during-dinner speech
something like this:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Somewhat overdone, but we
must judge the story not
as comedy but as farce,
which blithely assumes the
improbable as true.</div>

<p id="par16">16. “I like this fine. I never camped
out before; but I had a pet 'possum
once, and I was nine last birthday.
I hate to go to school. Rats
ate up sixteen of Jimmy Talbot’s
aunt’s speckled hen’s eggs. Are
there any real Indians in these
woods? I want some more gravy.
Does the trees moving make the wind
blow? We had five puppies. What
makes your nose so red, Hank? My
father has lots of money. Are the
stars hot? I whipped Ed Walker
twice, Saturday. I don’t like girls.
You dasent catch toads unless with
a string. Do oxen make any noise?
Why are oranges round? Have you
got beds to sleep on in this cave?
Amos Murray has got six toes. A
parrot can talk, but a monkey or a
fish can’t. How many does it take
to make twelve?”</p>



<p>17. Every few minutes he would
remember that he was a pesky red-skin,
and pick up his stick rifle and
tip-toe to the mouth of the cave to
rubber for the scouts of the hated
paleface. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Essential Situation.</span></span>Now and then he would
let out a war-whoop that made Old
Hank the Trapper, shiver. That boy
had Bill terrorized from the start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>18. “Red Chief,” says I to the kid,
“would you like to go home?”</p>

<p>19. “Aw, what for?” says he. “I
don’t have any fun at home. I hate
to go to school. I like to camp out. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Key.</span><br />
Use of the unexpected.</span>
You won’t take me back home again,
Snake-eye, will you?”</p>

<p>20. “Not right away,” says I.
“We’ll stay here in the cave a
while.”</p>

<p>21. “All right!” says he. “That’ll
be fine. I never had such fun in all
my life.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A tribute throughout to the
dime dreadful.</div>

<p>22. We went to bed about eleven
o’clock. We spread down some wide
blankets and quilts and put Red Chief
between us. We weren’t afraid he’d
run away. He kept us awake for
three hours, jumping up and reaching
for his rifle and screeching:
“Hist! pard,” in mine and Bill’s ears,
as the fancied crackle of a twig or
the rustle of a leaf revealed to his
young imagination the stealthy approach
of the outlaw band. <span class="sidenote">Narrator lapses now and
then into “better” language.</span> At last,
I fell into a troubled sleep, and
dreamed that I had been kidnapped
and chained to a tree by a ferocious
pirate with red hair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrast.</div>

<p>23. Just at daybreak, I was awakened
by a series of awful screams from
Bill. They weren’t yells, or howls,
or shouts, or whoops, or yawps, such
as you’d expect from a manly set
of vocal organs&mdash;they were simply
indecent, terrifying, humiliating
screams, such as women emit when
they see ghosts or caterpillars. It’s
an awful thing to hear a strong, desperate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
fat man scream incontinently
in a cave at daybreak.</p>

<p>24. I jumped up to see what the
matter was. Red Chief was sitting
on Bill’s chest, with one hand twined
in Bill’s hair. In the other he had the
sharp case-knife we used for slicing
bacon; and he was industriously and
realistically trying to take Bill’s
scalp, according to the sentence that
had been pronounced upon him the
evening before.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Plot Situation.</span></div>



<p>25. I got the knife away from the
kid and made him lie down again.
But, from that moment, Bill’s spirit
was broken. He laid down on his
side of the bed, but he never closed
an eye again in sleep as long as that
boy was with us. I dozed off for a <span class="sidenote">Note that the author develops
his story by the use
of progressive plot <em>situations</em>
and contributory
(non-essential) incidents.</span>
while, but along toward sun-up I remembered
that Red Chief had said
I was to be burned at the stake at
the rising of the sun. I wasn’t nervous
or afraid; but I sat up and lit
my pipe and leaned against a rock.</p>

<p>26. “What you getting up so soon
for, Sam?” asked Bill.</p>

<p>27. “Me?” says I. “Oh, I got a
kind of a pain in my shoulder. I
thought sitting up would rest it.”</p>

<p>28. “You’re a liar!” says Bill.
“You’re afraid. You was to be
burned at sunrise, and you was afraid
he’d do it. And he would, too, if
he could find a match. Ain’t it
awful, Sam? Do you think anybody
will pay out money to get a little imp
like that back home?”</p>

<p>29. “Sure,” said I. “A rowdy kid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
like that is just the kind that parents
dote on. Now, you and the Chief
get up and cook breakfast, while I go
up on the top of this mountain and
reconnoitre.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the humorous use of
the language of “literature”&mdash;sparingly.</div>

<p>30. I went up on the peak of the
little mountain and ran my eye over
the contiguous vicinity. Over toward
Summit I expected to see the sturdy
yeomanry of the village armed with
scythes and pitchforks beating the
country-side for the dastardly kidnappers.
But what I saw was a
peaceful landscape dotted with one
man ploughing with a dun mule. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Plot Situation.</span></span>
Nobody was dragging the creek; no
couriers dashed hither and yon,
bringing tidings of no news to the
distracted parents. There was a
sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness
pervading the section of the external
outward surface of Alabama
that lay exposed to my view. “Perhaps,”
says I to myself, “it has not
yet been discovered that the wolves
have borne away the tender lambkin
from the fold. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Key.</span></span> Heaven help the
wolves!” says I, and I went down
the mountain to breakfast.</p>

<p>31. When I got to the cave I found
Bill backed up against the side of it,
breathing hard, and the boy threatening
to smash him with a rock half
as big as a cocoanut.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrast of unexpected.</div>

<p>32. “He put a red-hot boiled potato
down my back,” explained Bill,
“and then mashed it with his foot;
and I boxed his ears. Have you got
a gun about you, Sam?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>33. I took the rock away from the
boy and kind of patched up the argument.
“I’ll fix you,” says the kid to
Bill. “No man ever yet struck the
Red Chief but what he got paid for
it. You better beware!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return to first style of narration.</div>

<p>34. After breakfast the kid takes a
piece of leather with strings wrapped
around it out of his pocket and goes
outside the cave unwinding it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Frank R. Stockton expression.</div>

<p>35. “What’s he up to now?” says
Bill, anxiously. “You don’t think
he’ll run away, do you, Sam?”</p>

<p>36. “No fear of it,” says I. “He
don’t seem to be much of a home
body. But we’ve got to fix up some
plan about the ransom. There don’t
seem to be much excitement around
Summit on account of his disappearance;
but maybe they haven’t realized
yet that he’s gone. His folks may
think he’s spending the night with
Aunt Jane or one of the neighbors.
Anyhow, he’ll be missed to-day. To-night
we must get a message to his
father demanding the two thousand
dollars for his return.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plot situation hidden, action
halts.</div>

<p>37. Just then we heard a kind of
war-whoop, such as David might have
emitted when he knocked out the
champion Goliath. It was a sling
that Red Chief had pulled out of his
pocket, and he was whirling it around
his head.</p>

<p>38. I dodged, and heard a heavy
thud and a kind of a sigh from Bill,
like a horse gives out when you take
his saddle off. A niggerhead rock
the size of an egg had caught Bill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
just behind the left ear. He loosened
himself all over and fell in the fire
across the frying pan of hot water
for washing the dishes. I dragged
him out and poured cold water on
his head for half an hour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This expression is more
clever than natural to
“Bill.”</div>

<p>39. By and by, Bill sits up and
feels behind his ear and says: “Sam,
do you know who my favorite Biblical
character is?”</p>

<p>40. “Take it easy,” says I.
“You’ll come to your senses presently.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slaughter of the Innocents.</div>

<p>41. “King Herod,” says he. “You
won’t go away and leave me here
alone, will you, Sam?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">See <a href="#par4">¶4</a>.</div>

<p>42. I went out and caught that boy
and shook him until his freckles rattled.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the use of the incongruous.</div>

<p>43. “If you don’t behave,” says I,
“I’ll take you straight home. Now,
are you going to be good, or not?”</p>

<p>44. “I was only funning,” says he
sullenly. “I didn’t mean to hurt Old
Hank. But what did he hit me for?
I’ll behave, Snake-eye, if you won’t
send me home, and if you’ll let me
play the Black Scout to-day.”</p>

<p>45. “I don’t know the game,” says
I. “That’s for you and Mr. Bill to
decide. He’s your playmate for the
day. I’m going away for a while, on
business. Now, you come in and
make friends with him and say you
are sorry for hurting him, or home
you go, at once.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Plot Incident.</span></div>

<p>46. I made him and Bill shake
hands, and then I took Bill aside and
told him I was going to Poplar Cove,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
a little village three miles from the
cave, and find out what I could about
how the kidnapping had been regarded
in Summit. Also, I thought it
best to send a peremptory letter to
old man Dorset that day, demanding
the ransom and dictating how it
should be paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Do these men seem like
actual criminals? See comment
on <a href="#par16">¶16</a>.</div>

<p>47. “You know, Sam,” says Bill,
“I’ve stood by you without batting
an eye in earthquakes, fire and flood&mdash;in
poker games, dynamite outrages,
police raids, train robberies and
cyclones. I never lost my nerve yet
till we kidnapped that two-legged
skyrocket of a kid. He’s got me going.
You won’t leave me long with
him, will you, Sam?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Irony.</div>

<p>48. “I’ll be back some time this
afternoon,” says I. “You must keep
the boy amused and quiet till I return.
And now we’ll write the letter
to old Dorset.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Key.</span></div>

<p>49. Bill and I got paper and pencil
and worked on the letter while Red
Chief, with a blanket wrapped around
him, strutted up and down, guarding
the mouth of the cave. Bill begged
me tearfully to make the ransom fifteen
hundred dollars instead of two
thousand. “I ain’t attempting,” says
he, “to decry the celebrated moral
aspect of parental affection, but we’re
dealing with humans, and it ain’t
human for anybody to give up two
thousand dollars for that forty-pound
chunk of freckled wildcat.
I’m willing to take a chance at fifteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
hundred dollars. You can charge the
difference up to me.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Preparation for Crisis.</span></div>

<p>50. So, to relieve Bill, I acceded,
and we collaborated a letter that
ran this way:</p>

<div class="sidenote">In intelligence of expression,
does this letter correspond
to the general
style of the narrator?</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Ebenezer Dorset, Esq.:</em></p>

<p>We have your boy concealed in a
place far from Summit. It is useless
for you or the most skilful
detectives to attempt to find him.
Absolutely, the only terms on which
you can have him restored to you are
these: We demand fifteen hundred
dollars in large bills for his return;
the money to be left at midnight at
the same spot and in the same box
as your reply&mdash;as hereinafter described.
If you agree to these terms,
send your answer in writing by a
solitary messenger to-night at half-past
eight o’clock. After crossing
Owl Creek, on the road to Poplar
Cove, there are three large trees
about a hundred yards apart, close
to the fence of the wheat field on
the right-hand side. At the bottom
of the fence-post, opposite the third
tree, will be found a small paste-board
box.</p>

<p>The messenger will place the answer
in this box and return immediately
to Summit.</p>

<p>If you attempt any treachery or
fail to comply with our demand as
stated, you will never see your boy
again.</p>

<p>If you pay the money as demanded,
he will be returned to you safe and
well within three hours. These
terms are final, and if you do not
accede to them no further communication
will be attempted.</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em; "><span class="smcap">Two Desperate Men.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>51. I addressed this letter to Dorset,
and put it in my pocket. As I
was about to start, the kid comes up
to me and says:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character delineation and
by-play.</div>

<p>52. “Aw, Snake-eye, you said I
could play the Black Scout while
you was gone.”</p>

<p>53. “Play it, of course,” says I.
“Mr. Bill will play with you. What
kind of a game is it?”</p>

<p>54. “I’m the Black Scout,” says
Red Chief, “and I have to ride to the
stockade to warn the settlers that the
Indians are coming. I’m so tired of
playing Indian myself. I want to be
the Black Scout.”</p>

<p>55. “All right,” says I. “It sounds
harmless to me. I guess Mr. Bill
will help you foil the pesky savages.”</p>

<p>56. “What am I to do?” says Bill,
looking at the kid suspiciously.</p>

<p>57. “You are the hoss,” says Black
Scout. “Get down on your hands
and knees. How can I ride to the
stockade without a hoss?”</p>

<p>58. “You’d better keep him interested,”
said I, “till we get the
scheme going. Loosen up.”</p>

<p>59. Bill gets down on his all fours,
and a look comes in his eye like a
rabbit’s when you catch it in a trap.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The two are typically in
character in these paragraphs.</div>

<p>60. “How far is it to the stockade,
Kid?” he asks, in a husky manner of
voice.</p>

<p>61. “Ninety miles,” says the Black
Scout. “And you have to hump
yourself to get there on time. Whoa,
now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>62. The Black Scout jumps on Bill’s
back and digs his heels in his side.</p>

<p>63. “For Heaven’s sake,” says Bill,
“hurry back, Sam, as soon as you
can. I wish we hadn’t made the ransom
more than a thousand. Say,
you quit kicking me or I’ll get up
and warm you good.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Plot Situation.</span></div>

<p>64. I walked over to Poplar Cove
and sat around the post-office and
store, talking with the chawbacons
that came in to trade. One whiskerando
says that he hears Summit is all
upset on account of Elder Ebenezer
Dorset’s boy having been lost or stolen.
That was all I wanted to know.
I bought some smoking tobacco, referred
casually to the price of black-eyed
peas, posted my letter surreptitiously
and came away. The
postmaster said the mail-carrier
would come by in an hour to take the
mail on to Summit.</p>

<p>65. When I got back to the cave
Bill and the boy were not to be
found. I explored the vicinity of the
cave, and risked a yodel or two, but
there was no response.</p>

<p>66. So I lighted my pipe and sat
down on a mossy bank to await developments.</p>

<p>67. In about half an hour I heard
the bushes rustle, and Bill wabbled
out into the little glade in front of
the cave. Behind him was the kid,
stepping softly like a scout, with a
broad grin on his face. Bill stopped,
took off his hat and wiped his face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
with a red handkerchief. The kid
stopped about eight feet behind
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Typical O. Henry speech in
this paragraph.</div>

<p>68. “Sam,” says Bill, “I suppose
you’ll think I’m a renegade, but I
couldn’t help it. I’m a grown person
with masculine proclivities and habits
of self-defence, but there is a time
when all systems of egotism and
predominance fail. The boy is gone.
I have sent him home. All is off.
There was martyrs in old times,”
goes on Bill, “that suffered death
rather than give up the particular
graft they enjoyed. None of ’em
ever was subjugated to such supernatural
tortures as I have been. I
tried to be faithful to our articles of
depredation; but there came a
limit.”</p>

<p>69. “What’s the trouble, Bill?” I
asks him.</p>

<p>70. “I was rode,” says Bill, “the
ninety miles to the stockade, not barring
an inch. Then, when the settlers
was rescued, I was given oats.
Sand ain’t a palatable substitute.
And then, for an hour I had to try to
explain to him why there was nothin’
in holes, how a road can run
both ways and what makes the grass
green. I tell you, Sam, a human can
only stand so much. I takes him by
the neck of his clothes and drags him
down the mountain. On the way he
kicks my legs black-and-blue from
the knees down; and I’ve got to
have two or three bites on my thumb
and hand cauterized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the stage trick of a
character in ignorance
while the audience enjoys
his delusion. The surprise
is his, not ours.</div>

<p>71. “But he’s gone”&mdash;continues
Bill&mdash;“gone home. I showed him
the road to Summit and kicked him
about eight feet nearer there at one
kick. I’m sorry we lose the ransom;
but it was either that or Bill Driscoll
to the madhouse.”</p>

<p>72. Bill is puffing and blowing but
there is a look of ineffable peace
and growing content on his rose-pink
features.</p>

<p>73. “Bill,” says I, “there isn’t any
heart disease in your family, is
there?”</p>

<p>74. “No,” says Bill, “nothing
chronic except malaria and accidents.
Why?”</p>

<p>75. “Then you might turn around,”
says I, “and have a look behind you.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suggestion.</div>

<p>76. Bill turns and sees the boy, and
loses his complexion and sits down
plump on the ground and begins to
pluck aimlessly at grass and little
sticks. For an hour I was afraid for
his mind. <span class="sidenote">Straight delineation. The
former is the better art.</span> And then I told him that
my scheme was to put the whole job
through immediately and that we
would get the ransom and be off with
it by midnight if old Dorset fell in
with our proposition. So Bill braced <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Plot Situation.</span></span>
up enough to give the kid a weak
sort of a smile and a promise to play
the Russian in a Japanese war with
him as soon as he felt a little better.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Plot Incident.</span></div>

<p>77. I had a scheme for collecting
that ransom without danger of being
caught by counterplots that ought to
commend itself to professional kidnappers.
The tree under which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
answer was to be left&mdash;and the
money later on&mdash;was close to the
road fence with big, bare fields on
all sides. If a gang of constables
should be watching for any one to
come for the note they could see
him a long way off crossing the fields
or in the road. But no sirree! At
half-past eight I was up in that tree
as well hidden as a tree toad, waiting
for the messenger to arrive.</p>

<p>78. Exactly on time, a half-grown
boy rides up the road on a bicycle,
locates the paste-board box at the
foot of the fence-post, slips a folded
piece of paper into it and pedals
away again back toward Summit.</p>

<p>79. I waited an hour and then concluded
the thing was square. I slid
down the tree, got the note, slipped
along the fence till I struck the
woods, and was back at the cave in
another half an hour. I opened the
note, got near the lantern and read
it to Bill. It was written with a pen
in a crabbed hand, and the sum and
substance of it was this:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Main Plot Incident.</span></div>

<p><em>Two Desperate Men.</em></p>

<p>Gentlemen: I received your letter
to-day by post, in regard to the ransom
you ask for the return of my
son. I think you are a little high
in your demands, and I hereby make
you a counter-proposition, which I
am inclined to believe you will accept.
You bring Johnny home and
pay me two hundred and fifty dollars
in cash, and I agree to take him off
your hands. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Climax.</span></span>You had better come at
night for the neighbors believe he is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
lost, and I couldn’t be responsible for
what they would do to anybody they
saw bringing him back.</p>

<p>Very respectfully,</p>

<p class="right" style="padding-right: 2em; "><span class="smcap">Ebenezer Dorset.</span></p>


<p>80. “Great pirates of Penzance!”
says I, “of all the impudent&mdash;”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suggestion.</div>

<p>81. But I glanced at Bill, and hesitated.
He had the most appealing
look in his eyes I ever saw on the face
of a dumb or a talking brute.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Serio-comic.</div>

<p>82. “Sam,” says he, “what’s two
hundred and fifty dollars, after all?
We’ve got the money. One more
night of this kid will send me to a
bed in Bedlam. Besides being a
thorough gentleman, I think Mr.
Dorset is a spendthrift for making
us a liberal offer. You ain’t going
to let the chance go, are you?”</p>

<p>83. “Tell you the truth, Bill,” says
I, “this little he ewe lamb has somewhat
got on my nerves, too. We’ll
take him home, pay the ransom, and
make our get-away.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Extreme of contrast.</div>

<p>84. We took him home that night.
We got him to go by telling him that
his father had bought a silver-mounted
rifle and a pair of moccasins for
him, and we were going to hunt
bears the next day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Denouement.</span></div>

<p>85. It was just twelve o’clock when
we knocked at Ebenezer’s front door.
Just at the moment when I should
have been abstracting the fifteen hundred
dollars from the box under the <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Contrasting Plot Situation</span>&mdash;Summary of the
plot-outcome.</span>
tree, according to the original proposition,
Bill was counting out two
hundred and fifty dollars into Dorset’s
hand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note free use of simile.</div>

<p>86. When the kid found out we
were going to leave him at home he
started up a howl like a calliope and
fastened himself as tight as a leech
to Bill’s leg. His father peeled him
away gradually, like a porous plaster.</p>

<p>87. “How long can you hold
him?” asks Bill.</p>

<p>88. “I’m not as strong as I used
to be,” says old Dorset. “But I
think I can promise you ten minutes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Humor of hyperbole.</div>

<p>89. “Enough,” says Bill. “In ten
minutes I shall cross the Central,
Southern and Middle Western States,
and be legging it trippingly for the
Canadian border.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Resultant Climax.</span></div>

<p>90. And, as dark as it was, and as
fat as Bill was, and as good a runner
as I am, he was a good mile and
half out of Summit before I could
catch up with him.</p>

<h3>BARRIE AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>James Matthew Barrie was born at Kirriemuir
(“Thrums”), Scotland, on the 9th of May, 1860. He
is the son of a physician, whom he has lovingly embodied
as “Dr. McQueen”; his mother and sister also will live
as “Jess” and “Leeby.” He was educated at Dumfries
Academy, entering the University of Edinburgh at eighteen,
from which he was graduated in 1882 with the
degree of M.A., taking honors in English literature. He
began writing literary criticisms for the <em>Edinburgh Courant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></em>
at this period. Several months after his graduation
Barrie took a position on a Nottingham newspaper, leaving
that city for London in 1885, where his literary career
commenced in earnest; but success did not come until
after the customary struggles and hindrances to which
young literary aspirants are ever subject. In 1893
he married Miss Ansell, an actress, whom he divorced
in 1909. Some of his best-known books are <em>Auld
Licht Idylls</em>; <em>A Window in Thrums</em>; <em>Margaret Ogilvy</em>;
<em>My Lady Nicotine</em>; <em>The Little Minister</em> (afterwards
dramatized); <em>Sentimental Tommy</em>; <em>Tommy and Grizel</em>
(a sequel), and <em>The Little White Bird</em>. He also wrote
several plays, the most notable of which are <em>The Professor’s
Love Story</em>; <em>Peter Pan</em> (a partial dramatization
of <em>The Little White Bird</em>); <em>Quality Street</em>; and <em>What
Every Woman Knows</em>. It is interesting to note that Mr.
Barrie did not succeed in securing the magazine publication
of “The Courting of T’Nowhead’s Bell,” which is
given herewith; it was first issued between book covers,
in 1888.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Barrie is a versatile story-teller, though he deals mostly
with Scotch characters. His early work exhibits his
short-story ability at its best. The warm human interest
of <em>A Window in Thrums</em> and <em>Auld Licht Idylls</em>, is
matched only by Ian Maclaren’s <em>Beside the Bonnie Briar
Bush</em> and <em>The Days of Auld Lang Syne</em>. A quaint
character-humor, with swift flashes of pathos, pervades
all his work, which for local-color and insight into the
character of the Scotch rural dweller has won a place of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
distinction among the stories of present-day writers.
With Barrie, realism is rarely unpleasant; he sees all
things with a gentle eye. Even when in his keen ability
to penetrate to the heart of things he discovers the weaknesses
of humanity, he also finds redeeming virtues.
Thus his characters are continually disclosing their true
natures underneath the garb and custom of picturesque
life, and we feel ourselves to be kin to them, every one.
His dialect in itself is masterly and often deliciously humorous,
so that actions and dialogue in themselves common-place
take on an extraordinary interest. No modern
writer has a greater gift of character-drawing, and none
is more sympathetically human in his interpretations of
the Scotch commoner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is my contemptible weakness that if I say a character smiled
vacuously, I must smile vacuously; if he frowns or leers, I frown
or leer; if he is a coward or given to contortions, I cringe, or
twist my legs until I have to stop writing to undo the knot.
I bow with him, eat with him, and gnaw my moustache with
him. If the character be a lady with an exquisite laugh, I suddenly
terrify you by laughing exquisitely. One reads of the
astounding versatility of an actor who is stout and lean on the
same evening, but what is he to the novelist who is a dozen
persons within the hour?&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. M. Barrie</span>, <em>Margaret Ogilvy</em>.</p>


<p>There are writers who can plan out their story beforehand as
clearly as though it were a railway journey, and adhere throughout
to their original design&mdash;they draw up what playwrights
call a scenario&mdash;but I was never one of those. I spend a great
deal of time indeed in looking for the best road in the map and
mark it with red ink, but at the first bypath off my characters
go. “Come back,” I cry, “you are off the road.” “We prefer
this way,” they reply. I try bullying. “You are only people in
a book,” I shout, “and it is my book, and I can do what I like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
with you, so come back!” But they seldom come, and it ends
with my plodding after them.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. M. Barrie</span>, Introduction to
<em>When a Man’s Single</em>.</p>

<p>The chief features of Barrie’s style are a quaintness of expression,
a simple directness of narrative, and an unfailing sense of
humor&mdash;often as though the author were chuckling to himself
as he wrote. His gift for descriptive writing&mdash;probably the
best test of “style”&mdash;is very marked, though he makes little of
it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">J. A. Hammerton</span>, <em>J. M. Barrie and His Books</em>.</p>

<p><em>Auld Licht Idylls</em> is a set of regular descriptions of the
life of “Thrums,” with special reference to the ways and character
of the “Old Lights,” the stubborn conservative Scotch
Puritans; it contains also a most amusing and characteristic
love story of the sect (“The Courting of T’Nowhead’s Bell”),
and a satiric political skit.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Charles Dudley Warner’s</span> <em>Library
of the World’s Best Literature</em>.</p>


<p>By the time “Auld Licht Idylls” appeared, he had achieved
a reputation,&mdash;at least a local one. This book had an immediate
success, and ran rapidly through several editions. His mother
had been an Auld Licht in her youth.... Mrs. Barrie, knowing
them from the inside, could tell all sorts of quaint and marvellous
tales about them, whose humor was sure to please. It was
from her stories that the Idylls were mainly drawn, so she was
in a sense a collaborator with her son in their production.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hattie
T. Griswold</span>, <em>Personal Sketches of Recent Authors</em>.</p>


<p>As a literary artist he belongs in the foremost rank. He has
that sense of the typical in incident, of the universal in feeling,
and of the suggestive in language, which mark the chiefs of
letters. No one can express an idea with fewer strokes; he
never expands a sufficient hint into an essay. His management
of the Scotch dialect is masterly: he uses it sparingly, in the
nearest form to English compatible with retaining the flavor;
he never makes it so hard as to interfere with enjoyment; in
few dialect writers do we feel so little alienness.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Charles
Dudley Warner’s</span> <em>Library of the World’s Best Literature</em>.

<h3>THE COURTING OF T’NOWHEAD’S BELL</h3>

<p class="big05 center">BY JAMES MATTHEW BARRIE</p>

<p class="p1">For two years it had been notorious
in the square that Sam’l Dickie
was thinking of courting T’Nowhead’s
Bell, and that if little Sanders Elshioner
(which is the Thrums pronunciation
of Alexander Alexander)
went in for her he might prove a
formidable rival. Sam’l was a weaver
in the Tenements, and Sanders a
coal-carter whose trade-mark was a
bell on his horse’s neck that told
when coals were coming. Being
something of a public man, Sanders
had not so high a social position as
Sam’l, but he had succeeded his father
on the coal-cart, while the weaver
had already tried several trades. It
had always been against Sam’l, too,
that once when the kirk was vacant
he had advised the selection of the
third minister who preached for it
on the ground that it came expensive
to pay a large number of candidates.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
The scandal of the thing was hushed
up, out of respect for his father, who
was a God-fearing man, but Sam’l
was known by it in Lang Tammas’
circle. The coal-carter was called
Little Sanders to distinguish him
from his father, who was not much
more than half his size. He had
grown up with the name, and its
inapplicability now came home to nobody.
Sam’l’s mother had been more
far-seeing than Sanders’. Her man
had been called Sammy all his life
because it was the name he got as a
boy, so when their eldest son was
born she spoke of him as Sam’l while
still in his cradle. The neighbours
imitated her, and thus the young man
had a better start in life than had
been granted to Sammy, his father.</p>

<p>2. It was Saturday evening&mdash;the
night in the week when Auld Licht
young men fell in love. Sam’l
Dickie, wearing a blue glengarry bonnet
with a red ball on the top, came
to the door of a one-story house in
the Tenements and stood there
wriggling, for he was in a suit of
tweeds for the first time that week,
and did not feel at one in them.
When his feeling of being a stranger
to himself wore off, he looked up
and down the road, which straggles
between houses and gardens, and
then, picking his way over the puddles,
crossed to his father’s henhouse
and sat down on it. He was now on
his way to the square.</p>

<p>3. Eppie Fargus was sitting on an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
adjoining dike knitting stockings,
and Sam’l looked at her for a time.</p>

<p>4. “Is’t yersel, Eppie?” he said at
last.</p>

<p>5. “It’s a’ that,” said Eppie.</p>

<p>6. “Hoo’s a’ wi’ ye?” asked Sam’l.</p>

<p>7. “We’re juist aff an’ on,” replied
Eppie cautiously.</p>

<p>8. There was not much more to
say, but as Sam’l sidled off the henhouse
he murmured politely, “Ay,
ay.” In another minute he would
have been fairly started, but Eppie
resumed the conversation.</p>

<p>9. “Sam’l,” she said, with a twinkle
in her eye, “ye can tell Lisbeth Fargus
I’ll likely be drappin’ in on her
aboot Munday or Teisday.”</p>

<p>10. Lisbeth was sister to Eppie, and
wife of Tammas McQuhatty, better
known as T’Nowhead, which was the
name of his farm. She was thus
Bell’s mistress.</p>

<p>11. Sam’l leaned against the henhouse
as if all his desire to depart
had gone.</p>

<p>12. “Hoo d’ye kin I’ll be at the
T’Nowhead the nicht?” he asked,
grinning in anticipation.</p>

<p>13. “Ou, I’se warrant ye’ll be after
Bell,” said Eppie.</p>

<p>14. “Am no sure o’ that,” said
Sam’l, trying to leer. He was enjoying
himself now.</p>

<p>15. “Am no sure o’ that,” he repeated,
for Eppie seemed lost in
stitches.</p>

<p>16. “Sam’l&mdash;”</p>

<p>17. “Ay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Asking her.</div>

<p>18. “Ye’ll be spierin’ her sune noo,
I dinna doot?”</p>

<p>19. This took Sam’l, who had only
been courting Bell for a year or two,
a little aback.</p>

<p>20. “Hoo d’ye mean, Eppie?” he
asked.</p>

<p>21. “Maybe ye’ll do’t the nicht.”</p>

<p>22. “Na, there’s nae hurry,” said
Sam’l.</p>

<p>23. “Weel, we’re a’ coontin’ on’t,
Sam’l.”</p>

<p>24. “Gae wa wi’ ye.”</p>

<p>25. “What for no?”</p>

<p>26. “Gae wa wi’ ye,” said Sam’l
again.</p>

<p>27. “Bell’s gie an’ fond o’ ye,
Sam’l.”</p>

<p>28. “Ay,” said Sam’l.</p>

<p>29. “But am dootin’ ye’re a fell
billy wi’ the lasses.”</p>

<p>30. “Ay, oh, I d’na kin, moderate,
moderate,” said Sam’l, in high delight.</p>

<p>31. “I saw ye,” said Eppie, speaking
with a wire in her mouth, “gaein’
on terr’ble wi’ Mysy Haggart at the
pump last Saturday.”</p>

<p>32. “We was juist amoosin’ oorsels,”
said Sam’l.</p>

<p>33. “It’ll be nae amoosement to
Mysy,” said Eppie, “gin ye brak her
heart.”</p>

<p>34. “Losh, Eppie,” said Sam’l, “I
didna think o’ that.”</p>

<p>35. “Ye maun kin weel, Sam’l, 'at
there’s mony a lass wid jump at ye.”</p>

<p>36. “Ou, weel,” said Sam’l, implying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
that a man must take these things
as they come.</p>

<p>37. “For ye’re a dainty chield to
look at, Sam’l.”</p>

<p>38. “Do ye think so, Eppie? Ay,
ay; oh, I d’na kin am onything by
the ordinar.”</p>

<p>39. “Ye mayna be,” said Eppie,
“but lasses doesna do to be ower
partikler.”</p>

<p>40. Sam’l resented this, and prepared
to depart again.</p>

<p>41. “Ye’ll no tell Bell that?” he
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>42. “Tell her what?”</p>

<p>43. “Aboot me an’ Mysy.”</p>

<p>44. “We’ll see hoo ye behave
yersel, Sam’l.”</p>

<p>45. “No 'at I care, Eppie; ye can
tell her gin ye like. I widna think
twice o’ tellin’ her mysel.”</p>

<p>46. “The Lord forgie ye for leein’,
Sam’l,” said Eppie, as he disappeared
down Tammy Tosh’s close. <span class="sidenote">Alley, or court.</span> Here he
came upon Henders Webster.</p>

<p>47. “Ye’re late, Sam’l,” said Henders.</p>

<p>48. “What for?”</p>

<p>49. “Ou, I was thinkin’ ye wid be
gaen the length o’ T’Nowhead the
nicht, an’ I saw Sanders Elshioner
makkin’s wy there an oor syne.”</p>

<p>50. “Did ye?” cried Sam’l, adding
craftily, “but it’s naething to me.”</p>

<p>51. “Tod, lad,” said Henders, “gin
ye dinna buckle to, Sanders’ll be
carryin’ her off.”</p>

<p>52. Sam’l flung back his head and
passed on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>53. “Sam’l!” cried Henders after
him.</p>

<p>54. “Ay,” said Sam’l, wheeling
round.</p>

<p>55. “Gie Bell a kiss frae me.”</p>

<p>56. The full force of this joke
struck neither all at once. Sam’l began
to smile at it as he turned down
the school-wynd, and it came upon
Henders while he was in his garden
feeding his ferret. Then he slapped
his legs gleefully, and explained the
conceit to Will’um Byars, who went
into the house and thought it over.</p>

<p>57. There were twelve or twenty
little groups of men in the square,
which was lit by a flare of oil suspended
over a cadger’s cart. Now
and again a staid young woman passed
through the square with a basket
on her arm, and if she had lingered
long enough to give them time, some
of the idlers would have addressed
her. As it was, they gazed after her,
and then grinned to each other.</p>

<p>58. “Ay, Sam’l,” said two or three
young men as Sam’l joined them beneath
the town clock.</p>

<p>59. “Ay, Davit,” replied Sam’l.</p>

<p>60. This group was composed of
some of the sharpest wits in Thrums,
and it was not to be expected that
they would let this opportunity pass.
Perhaps when Sam’l joined them he
knew what was in store for him.</p>

<p>61. “Was ye lookin’ for T’Nowhead’s
Bell, Sam’l?” asked one.</p>

<p>62. “Or mebbe ye was wantin’ the
minister?” suggested another, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
same who had walked out twice with
Christy Duff and not married her
after all.</p>

<p>63. Sam’l could not think of a good
reply at the moment, so he laughed
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>64. “Ondoobtedly she’s a snod bit
crittur,” said Davit archly.</p>

<p>65. “An’ michty clever wi’ her
fingers,” added Jamie Deuchars.</p>

<p>66. “Man, I’ve thocht o’ makkin’
up to Bell mysel,” said Peter Ogle.
“Wid there be ony chance, think ye,
Sam’l?”</p>

<p>67. “I’m thinkin’ she widna hae
ye for her first, Pete,” replied Sam’l,
in one of those happy flashes that
come to some men, “but there’s nae
sayin’ but what she micht tak ye to
finish up wi’.”</p>

<p>68. The unexpectedness of this sally
startled everyone. Though Sam’l
did not set up for a wit, however,
like Davit, it was notorious that he
could say a cutting thing once in a
way.</p>

<p>69. “Did ye ever see Bell reddin’
up?” asked Pete, recovering from his
overthrow. He was a man who bore
no malice.</p>

<p>70. “It’s a sicht,” said Sam’l solemnly.</p>

<p>71. “Hoo will that be?” asked
Jamie Deuchars.</p>


<p>72. “It’s well worth yer while,”
said Pete, “to ging atower to the
T’Nowhead an’ see. Ye’ll mind the
closed-in beds i’ the kitchen? Ay,
well, they’re a fell spoilt crew,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
T’Nowhead’s litlins, an’ no that aisy
to manage. <span class="sidenote">Little ones.</span> Th’ither lasses Lisbeth’s
hae’n had a michty trouble wi’ them.
When they war i’ the middle o’ their
reddin’ up the bairns wid come tumlin’
about the floor, but, sal, I assure
ye, Bell didna fash lang wi’ them.
Did she, Sam’l?”</p>

<p>73. “She did not,” said Sam’l,
dropping into a fine mode of speech
to add emphasis to his remark.</p>

<p>74. “I’ll tell ye what she did,”
said Pete to the others. “She juist
lifted up the litlins, twa at a time,
an’ flung them into the coffin-beds.
Syne she snibbit the doors on them,
an’ keepit them there till the floor
was dry.”</p>

<p>75. “Ay, man, did she so?” said
Davit admiringly.</p>

<p>76. “I’ve seen her do’t mysel,”
said Sam’l.</p>

<p>77. “There’s no a lassie makes better
bannocks this side o’ Fetter
Lums,” continued Pete.</p>

<p>78. “Her mither tocht her that,”
said Sam’l; “she was a gran’ han’ at
the bakin’, Kitty Ogilvy.”</p>

<p>79. “I’ve heard say,” remarked
Jamie, putting it this way, so as not
to tie himself down to anything, “'at
Bell’s scones is equal to Mag Lunan’s.”</p>

<p>80. “So they are,” said Sam’l, almost
fiercely.</p>

<p>81. “I kin she’s a neat han’ at
singein’ a hen,” said Pete.</p>

<p>82. “An’ wi’t a’,” said Davit, “she’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
a snod, canty bit stocky in her Sabbath
claes.”</p>

<p>83. “If onything, thick in the
waist,” suggested Jamie.</p>

<p>84. “I dinna see that,” said Sam’l.</p>

<p>85. “I d’na care for her hair
either,” continued Jamie, who was
very nice in his tastes; “something
mair yallowchy wid be an improvement.”</p>

<p>86. “A’body kins,” growled Sam’l,
“'at black hair’s the bonniest.”</p>

<p>87. The others chuckled.</p>

<p>88. “Puir Sam’l!” Pete said.</p>

<p>89. Sam’l not being certain whether
this should be received with a smile
or a frown, opened his mouth wide as
a kind of compromise. This was
position one with him for thinking
things over.</p>

<p>90. Few Auld Lichts, as I have
said, went the length of choosing a
helpmate for themselves. One day a
young man’s friends would see him
mending the washing-tub of a maiden’s
mother. They kept the joke
until Saturday night, and then he
learned from them what he had been
after. It dazed him for a time, but
in a year or so he grew accustomed
to the idea, and they were then married.
With a little help he fell in
love just like other people.</p>

<p>91. Sam’l was going the way of the
others, but he found it difficult to
come to the point. He only went
courting once a week, and he could
never take up the running at the
place where he left off the Saturday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
before. Thus he had not, so far,
made great headway. His method of
making up to Bell had been to drop
in at T’Nowhead on Saturday nights
and talk with the farmer about the
rinderpest.</p>

<p>92. The farm kitchen was Bell’s
testimonial. Its chairs, tables, and
stools were scoured by her to the
whiteness of Rob Angus’s sawmill
boards, and the muslin blind on the
window was starched like a child’s
pinafore. Bell was brave, too, as
well as energetic. Once Thrums had
been overrun with thieves. It is now
thought that there may have been
only one, but he had the wicked
cleverness of a gang. Such was his
repute that there were weavers who
spoke of locking their doors when
they went from home. He was not
very skilful, however, being generally
caught, and when they said they knew
he was a robber he gave them their
things back and went away. If they
had given him time there is no doubt
that he would have gone off with his
plunder. One night he went to
T’Nowhead, and Bell, who slept in the
kitchen, was wakened by the noise.
She knew who it would be, so she
rose and dressed herself and went to
look for him with a candle. The
thief had not known what to do
when he got in, and as it was very
lonely he was glad to see Bell.
She told him he ought to be ashamed
of himself, and would not let him
out by the door until he had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
off his boots so as not to soil the
carpet.</p>

<p>93. On this Saturday evening
Sam’l stood his ground in the
square, until by and by he found himself
alone. There were other groups
there still, but his circle had melted
away. They went separately, and no
one said good-night. Each took himself
off slowly, backing out of the
group until he was fairly started.</p>

<p>94. Sam’l looked about him, and
then, seeing that the others had gone,
walked round the townhouse into the
darkness of the brae that leads down
and then up to the farm of T’Nowhead.</p>

<p>95. To get into the good graces of
Lisbeth Fargus you had to know her
ways and humour them. Sam’l, who
was a student of women, knew this,
and so, instead of pushing the door
open and walking in, he went
through the rather ridiculous ceremony
of knocking. Sanders Elshioner
was also aware of this weakness
of Lisbeth’s, but, though he
often made up his mind to knock,
the absurdity of the thing prevented
his doing so when he reached
the door. T’Nowhead himself had
never got used to his wife’s refined
notions, and when any one knocked
he always started to his feet, thinking
there must be something wrong.</p>

<p>96. Lisbeth came to the door, her
expansive figure blocking the way in.</p>

<p>97. “Sam’l,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>98. “Lisbeth,” said Sam’l.</p>

<p>99. He shook hands with the farmer’s
wife, knowing that she liked it,
but only said, “Ay, Bell,” to his
sweetheart, “Ay, T’Nowhead,” to McQuhatty,
and “It’s yersel, Sanders,”
to his rival.</p>

<p>100. They were sitting round the
fire, T’Nowhead, with his feet on the
ribs, wondering why he felt so warm,
and Bell darned a stocking, while
Lisbeth kept an eye on a goblet full
of potatoes.</p>

<p>101. “Sit into the fire, Sam’l,” said
the farmer, not, however, making
way for him.</p>

<p>102. “Na, na,” said Sam’l, “I’m
to bide nae time.” Then he sat into
the fire. His face was turned away
from Bell, and when she spoke he
answered her without looking round.
Sam’l felt a little anxious. Sanders
Elshioner, who had one leg shorter
than the other, but looked well when
sitting, seemed suspiciously at home.
He asked Bell questions out of his
own head, which was beyond Sam’l,
and once he said something to her
in such a low voice that the others
could not catch it. T’Nowhead
asked curiously what it was, and
Sanders explained that he had only
said, “Ay, Bell, the morn’s the Sabbath.”
There was nothing startling
in this, but Sam’l did not like it. He
began to wonder if he was too late,
and had he seen his opportunity
would have told Bell of a nasty
rumour that Sanders intended to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
over to the Free Church if they
would make him kirk-officer.</p>

<p>103. Sam’l had the good-will of
T’Nowhead’s wife, who liked a polite
man. Sanders did his best, but from
want of practice he constantly made
mistakes. To-night, for instance, he
wore his hat in the house because he
did not like to put up his hand and
take it off. T’Nowhead had not taken
his off either but that was because he
meant to go out by and by and lock
the byre door. It was impossible to
say which of her lovers Bell preferred.
The proper course with an
Auld Licht lassie was to prefer the
man who proposed to her.</p>

<p>104. “Ye’ll bide a wee, an’ hae
something to eat?” Lisbeth asked
Sam’l, with her eyes on the goblet.</p>

<p>105. “No, I thank ye,” said Sam’l,
with true gentility.</p>

<p>106. “Ye’ll better?”</p>

<p>107. “I dinna think it.”</p>

<p>108. “Hoots aye; what’s to hender
ye?”</p>

<p>109. “Weel, since ye’re sae pressin’,
I’ll bide.”</p>

<p>110. No one asked Sanders to stay.
Bell could not, for she was but the
servant, and T’Nowhead knew that
the kick his wife had given him
meant that he was not to do so either.
Sanders whistled to show that he was
not uncomfortable.</p>

<p>111. “Ay then, I’ll be stappin’ ower
the brae,” he said at last.</p>

<p>112. He did not go, however.
There was sufficient pride in him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
get him off his chair, but only slowly,
for he had to get accustomed to the
notion of going. At intervals of
two or three minutes he remarked
that he must now be going. In the
same circumstances Sam’l would have
acted similarly. For a Thrums man
it is one of the hardest things in life
to get away from anywhere.</p>

<p>113. At last Lisbeth saw that something
must be done. The potatoes
were burning, and T’Nowhead had an
invitation on his tongue.</p>

<p>114. “Yes, I’ll hae to be movin’,”
said Sanders, hopelessly, for the fifth
time.</p>

<p>115. “Guid nicht to ye, then, Sanders,”
said Lisbeth. “Gie the door
a fling-to, ahent ye.”</p>

<p>116. Sanders, with a mighty effort,
pulled himself together. He looked
boldly at Bell, and then took off his
hat carefully. Sam’l saw with misgivings
that there was something in
it which was not a handkerchief. It
was a paper bag glittering with gold
braid, and contained such an assortment
of sweets as lads bought for
their lasses on the Muckle Friday.</p>

<p>117. “Hae, Bell,” said Sanders,
handing the bag to Bell in an off-hand
way as if it were but a trifle.
Nevertheless he was a little excited,
for he went off without saying good-night.</p>

<p>118. No one spoke. Bell’s face was
crimson. T’Nowhead fidgeted on his
chair, and Lisbeth looked at Sam’l.
The weaver was strangely calm and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
collected, though he would have liked
to know whether this was a proposal.</p>

<p>119. “Sit in by to the table, Sam’l,”
said Lisbeth, trying to look as if
things were as they had been before.</p>

<p>120. She put a saucerful of butter,
salt, and pepper near the fire to melt,
for melted butter is the shoeing-horn
that helps over a meal of potatoes.
Sam’l, however, saw what the hour
required, and jumping up, he seized
his bonnet.</p>

<p>121. “Hing the tatties higher up
the joist, Lisbeth,” he said with
dignity; “I’se be back in ten
meenits.”</p>

<p>122. He hurried out of the house,
leaving the others looking at each
other.</p>

<p>123. “What do ye think?” asked
Lisbeth.</p>

<p>124. “I d’na kin,” faltered Bell.</p>

<p>125. “Thae tatties is lang o’ comin’
to the boil,” said T’Nowhead.</p>

<p>126. In some circles a lover who
behaved like Sam’l would have been
suspected of intent upon his rival’s
life, but neither Bell nor Lisbeth did
the weaver that injustice. In a case
of this kind it does not much matter
what T’Nowhead thought.</p>

<p>127. The ten minutes had barely
passed when Sam’l was back in the
farm kitchen. He was too flurried to
knock this time, and, indeed, Lisbeth
did not expect it of him.</p>

<p>128. “Bell, hae!” he cried, handing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
his sweetheart a tinsel bag twice the
size of Sander’s gift.</p>

<p>129. “Losh preserve’s!” exclaimed
Lisbeth; “I’se warrant there’s a
shillin’s worth.”</p>

<p>130. “There’s a’ that, Lisbeth&mdash;an’
mair,” said Sam’l, firmly.</p>

<p>131. “I thank ye, Sam’l,” said Bell,
feeling an unwonted elation as she
gazed at the two paper bags in her
lap.</p>

<p>132. “Ye’re ower extravegint,
Sam’l,” Lisbeth said.</p>

<p>133. “Not at all,” said Sam’l; “not
at all. But I widna advise ye to eat
thae ither anes, Bell&mdash;they’re second
quality.”</p>

<p>134. Bell drew back a step from
Sam’l.</p>

<p>135. “How do ye kin?” asked the
farmer shortly, for he liked Sanders.</p>

<p>136. “I spiered i’ the shop,” said
Sam’l.</p>

<p>137. The goblet was placed on a
broken plate on the table with the
saucer beside it, and Sam’l, like the
others, helped himself. What he did
was to take potatoes from the pot
with his fingers, peel off their coats,
and then dip them into the butter.
Lisbeth would have liked to provide
knives and forks, but she knew
that beyond a certain point T’Nowhead
was master in his own house.
As for Sam’l, he felt victory in his
hands, and began to think that he
had gone too far.</p>

<p>138. In the meantime Sanders,
little witting that Sam’l had trumped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
his trick, was sauntering along
the kirk-wynd with his hat on the
side of his head. Fortunately he
did not meet the minister.</p>

<p>139. The courting of T’Nowhead’s
Bell reached its crisis one Sabbath
about a month after the events above
recorded. The minister was in great
force that day, but it is no part of
mine to tell how he bore himself. I
was there, and am not likely to forget
the scene. It was a fateful Sabbath
for T’Nowhead’s Bell and her
swains, and destined to be remembered
for the painful scandal which
they perpetrated in their passion.</p>

<p>140. Bell was not in the kirk.
There being an infant of six months
in the house it was a question of
either Lisbeth or the lassie’s staying
at home with him, and though
Lisbeth was unselfish in a general
way, she could not resist the delight
of going to church. She had
nine children besides the baby, and
being but a woman, it was the pride
of her life to march them into the
T’Nowhead pew, so well watched
that they dared not misbehave, and
so tightly packed that they could not
fall. The congregation looked at
that pew, the mothers enviously,
when they sang the lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container p11 pw15">
<div class="poetry">
<p>“Jerusalem like a city is<br />
Compactly built together.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>141. The first half of the service
had been gone through on this particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
Sunday without anything remarkable
happening. It was at the
end of the psalm which preceded the
sermon that Sanders Elshioner, who
sat near the door, lowered his head
until it was no higher than the pews,
and in that attitude, looking almost
like a four-footed animal, slipped out
of the church. In their eagerness
to be at the sermon many of the
congregation did not notice him, and
those who did put the matter by in
their minds for future investigation.
Sam’l, however, could not take it
so coolly. From his seat in the gallery
he saw Sanders disappear, and
his mind misgave him. With the
true lover’s instinct he understood
it all. Sanders had been struck by
the fine turn-out in the T’Nowhead’s
pew. Bell was alone at the farm.
What an opportunity to work one’s
way up to a proposal. T’Nowhead
was so overrun with children that
such a chance seldom occurred, except
on a Sabbath. Sanders, doubtless,
was off to propose, and he,
Sam’l, was left behind.</p>

<p>142. The suspense was terrible.
Sam’l and Sanders had both known
all along that Bell would take the
first of the two who asked her.
Even those who thought her proud
admitted that she was modest. Bitterly
the weaver repented having
waited so long. Now it was too late.
In ten minutes Sanders would be at
T’Nowhead; in an hour all would be
over. Sam’l rose to his feet in a daze.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
His mother pulled him down by the
coat-tail, and his father shook him,
thinking he was walking in his sleep.
He tottered past them, however,
hurried up the aisle, which was so
narrow that Dan’l Ross could only
reach his seat by walking sideways,
and was gone before the minister
could do more than stop in the middle
of a whirl and gape in horror
after him.</p>

<p>143. A number of the congregation
felt that day the advantage of sitting
in the loft. What was a mystery
to those downstairs was revealed
to them. From the gallery windows
they had a fine open view to
the south; and as Sam’l took the
common, which was a short cut
though a steep ascent, to T’Nowhead,
he was never out of their line of
vision. Sanders was not to be seen,
but they guessed rightly the reason
why. Thinking he had ample time,
he had gone round by the main road
to save his boots&mdash;perhaps a little
scared by what was coming. Sam’l’s
design was to forestall him by taking
the shorter path over the burn and
up the common.</p>

<p>144. It was a race for a wife, and
several onlookers in the gallery braved
the minister’s displeasure to see
who won. Those who favoured
Sam’l’s suit exultingly saw him leap
the stream, while the friends of
Sanders fixed their eyes on the top of
the common where it ran into the
road. Sanders must come into sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
there, and the one who reached this
point first would get Bell.</p>

<p>145. As Auld Lichts do not walk
abroad on the Sabbath, Sanders
would probably not be delayed. The
chances were in his favour. Had it
been any other day in the week Sam’l
might have run. So some of the
congregation in the gallery were
thinking, when suddenly they saw
him bend low and then take to his
heels. He had caught sight of Sander’s
head bobbing over the hedge
that separated the road from the
common, and feared that Sanders
might see him. The congregation
who could crane their necks sufficiently
saw a black object, which they
guessed to be the carter’s hat, crawling
along the hedge-top. For a
moment it was motionless, and then
it shot ahead. The rivals had seen
each other. It was now a hot race.
Sam’l, dissembling no longer, clattered
up the common, becoming smaller
and smaller to the onlookers as he
neared the top. More than one person
in the gallery almost rose to their
feet in their excitement. Sam’l had
it. No, Sanders was in front. Then
the two figures disappeared from
view. They seemed to run into each
other at the top of the brae, and no
one could say who was first. The
congregation looked at one another.
Some of them perspired. But the
minister held on his course.</p>

<p>146. Sam’l had just been in time to
cut Sanders out. It was the weaver’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
saving that Sanders saw this when
his rival turned the corner; for
Sam’l was sadly blown. Sanders
took in the situation and gave in at
once. The last hundred yards of
the distance he covered at his leisure,
and when he arrived at his destination
he did not go in. It was a fine
afternoon for the time of the year,
and he went round to have a look
at the pig, about which T’Nowhead
was a little sinfully puffed up.</p>

<p>147. “Ay,” said Sanders, digging
his fingers critically into the grunting
animal; “quite so.”</p>

<p>148. “Grumph,” said the pig, getting
reluctantly to his feet.</p>

<p>149. “Ou ay; yes,” said Sanders,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>150. Then he sat down on the edge
of the sty, and looked long and
silently at an empty bucket. But
whether his thoughts were of T’Nowhead’s
Bell, whom he had lost for
ever, or of the food the farmer fed
his pig on, is not known.</p>

<p>151. “Lord preserve’s! Are ye no
at the kirk?” cried Bell, nearly dropping
the baby as Sam’l broke into the
room.</p>

<p>152. “Bell!” cried Sam’l.</p>

<p>153. Then T’Nowhead’s Bell knew
that her hour had come.</p>

<p>154. “Sam’l,” she faltered.</p>

<p>155. “Will ye hae’s, Bell?” demanded
Sam’l, glaring at her sheepishly.</p>

<p>156. “Ay,” answered Bell.</p>

<p>157. Sam’l fell into a chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>158. “Bring’s drink o’ water, Bell,”
he said. But Bell thought the occasion
required milk, and there was
none in the kitchen. She went out
to the byre, still with the baby in her
arms, and saw Sanders Elshioner
sitting gloomily on the pigsty.</p>

<p>159. “Weel, Bell,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>160. “I thocht ye’d been at the
kirk, Sanders,” said Bell.</p>

<p>161. Then there was a silence between
them.</p>

<p>162. “Has Sam’l spiered ye, Bell?”
asked Sanders, stolidly.</p>

<p>163. “Ay,” said Bell again, and this
time there was a tear in her eye.
Sanders was little better than an
“orra man,” and Sam’l was a weaver,
and yet&mdash;But it was too
late now. Sanders gave the pig a
vicious poke with a stick, and when
it had ceased to grunt, Bell was back
in the kitchen. She had forgotten
about the milk, however, and Sam’l
only got water after all.</p>

<p>164. In after days, when the story
of Bell’s wooing was told, there were
some who held that the circumstances
would have almost justified the lassie
in giving Sam’l the go-by. But these
perhaps forgot that her other lover
was in the same predicament as the
accepted one&mdash;that of the two, indeed,
he was the more to blame, for
he set off to T’Nowhead on the Sabbath
of his own accord, while Sam’l
only ran after him. And then there
is no one to say for certain whether
Bell heard of her suitors’ delinquencies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
until Lisbeth’s return from
the kirk. Sam’l could never remember
whether he told her, and Bell
was not sure whether, if he did, she
took it in. Sanders was greatly in
demand for weeks after to tell what
he knew of the affair, but though he
was twice asked to tea to the manse
among the trees, and subjected thereafter
to ministerial cross-examinations,
this is all he told. He remained
at the pigsty until Sam’l left
the farm, when he joined him at the
top of the brae, and they went home
together.</p>

<p>165. “It’s yersel, Sanders,” said
Sam’l.</p>

<p>166. “It is so, Sam’l,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>167. “Very cauld,” said Sam’l.</p>

<p>168. “Blawy,” assented Sanders.</p>

<p>169. After a pause&mdash;</p>

<p>170. “Sam’l,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>171. “Ay.”</p>

<p>172. “I’m hearin’ yer to be mairit.”</p>

<p>173. “Ay.”</p>

<p>174. “Weel, Sam’l she’s a snod bit
lassie.”</p>

<p>175. “Thank ye,” said Sam’l.</p>

<p>176. “I had ance a kin’ o’ notion
o’ Bell mysel,” continued Sanders.</p>

<p>177. “Ye had?”</p>

<p>178. “Yes, Sam’l; but I thocht
better o’t.”</p>

<p>179. “Hoo d’ye mean?” asked
Sam’l, a little anxiously.</p>

<p>180. “Weel, Sam’l, mairitch is a
terrible responsibeelity.”</p>

<p>181. “It is so,” said Sam’l, wincing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>182. “An’ no the thing to tak up
withoot conseederation.”</p>

<p>183. “But it’s a blessed and honourable
state, Sanders; ye’ve heard
the minister on’t.”</p>

<p>184. “They say,” continued the
relentless Sanders, “'at the minister
doesna get on sair wi’ the wife himsel.”</p>

<p>185. “So they do,” cried Sam’l,
with a sinking at the heart.</p>

<p>186. “I’ve been telt,” Sanders
went on, “'at gin ye can get the upper
han’ o’ the wife for a while at
first, there’s the mair chance o’ a
harmonious exeestence.”</p>

<p>187. “Bell’s no the lassie,” said
Sam’l, appealingly, “to thwart her
man.”</p>

<p>188. Sanders smiled.</p>

<p>189. “D’ye ye think she is, Sanders?”</p>

<p>190. “Weel, Sam’l, I d’na want to
fluster ye, but she’s been ower lang
wi’ Lisbeth Fargus no to hae learnt
her ways. An a’body kins what a
life T’Nowhead has wi’ her.”</p>

<p>191. “Guid sake, Sanders, hoo did
ye no speak o’ this afore?”</p>

<p>192. “I thocht ye kent o’t, Sam’l.”</p>

<p>193. They had now reached the
square, and the U. P. kirk was coming
out. The Auld Licht kirk would
be half an hour yet.</p>

<p>194. “But, Sanders,” said Sam’l,
brightening up, “ye was on yer wy to
spier her yersel.”</p>

<p>195. “I was, Sam’l,” said Sanders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
“and I canna but be thankfu’ ye was
ower quick for’s.”</p>

<p>196. “Gin’t hadna been you,” said
Sam’l, “I wid never hae thocht o’t.”</p>

<p>197. “I’m sayin’ naething agin
Bell,” pursued the other, “but, man
Sam’l, a body should be mair deleeberate
in a thing o’ the kind.”</p>

<p>198. “It was michty hurried,” said
Sam’l, woefully.</p>

<p>199. “It’s a serious thing to spier
a lassie,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>200. “It’s an awfu’ thing,” said
Sam’l.</p>

<p>201. “But we’ll hope for the best,”
added Sanders, in a hopeless voice.</p>

<p>202. They were close to the Tenements
now, and Sam’l looked as if
he were on his way to be hanged.</p>

<p>203. “Sam’l?”</p>

<p>204. “Ay, Sanders.”</p>

<p>205. “Did ye&mdash;did ye kiss her,
Sam’l?”</p>

<p>206. “Na.”</p>

<p>207. “Hoo?”</p>

<p>208. “There was varra little time,
Sanders.”</p>

<p>209. “Half an 'oor,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>210. “Was there? Man Sanders,
to tell ye the truth, I never thoct
o’t.”</p>

<p>211. Then the soul of Sanders
Elshioner was filled with contempt
for Sam’l Dickie.</p>

<p>212. The scandal blew over. At
first it was expected that the minister
would interfere to prevent the
union, but beyond intimating from
the pulpit that the souls of Sabbath-breakers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
were beyond praying for,
and then praying for Sam’l and Sanders
at great length, with a word
thrown in for Bell, he let things take
their course. Some said it was because
he was always frightened lest
his young men should intermarry
with other denominations, but Sanders
explained it differently to Sam’l.</p>

<p>213. “I hav’na a word to say agin
the minister,” he said, “they’re gran’
prayers, but, Sam’l, he’s a mairit man
himsel.”</p>

<p>214. “He’s a’ the better for that,
Sanders, isna he?”</p>

<p>215. “Do ye no see,” asked Sanders,
compassionately, “'at he’s tryin’
to mak the best o’t?”</p>

<p>216. “Oh, Sanders, man!” said
Sam’l.</p>

<p>217. “Cheer up, Sam’l,” said Sanders,
“it’ll sune be ower.”</p>

<p>218. Their having been rival suitors
had not interfered with their
friendship. On the contrary, while
they had hitherto been mere acquaintances,
they became inseparables
as the wedding-day drew near. It
was noticed that they had much to
say to each other, and that when they
could not get a room to themselves
they wandered about together in the
churchyard. When Sam’l had anything
to tell Bell he sent Sanders to
tell it, and Sanders did as he was
bid. There was nothing that he
would not have done for Sam’l.</p>

<p>219. The more obliging Sanders
was, however, the sadder Sam’l grew.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
He never laughed now on Saturdays,
and sometimes his loom was silent
half the day. Sam’l felt that Sanders’s
was the kindness of a friend
for a dying man.</p>

<p>220. It was to be a penny wedding,
and Lisbeth Fargus said it was delicacy
that made Sam’l superintend the
fitting-up of the barn by deputy.
Once he came to see it in person,
but he looked so ill that Sanders had
to see him home. This was on the
Thursday afternoon, and the wedding
was fixed for Friday.</p>

<p>221. “Sanders, Sanders,” said
Sam’l, in a voice strangely unlike his
own, “it’ll a’ be ower by this time
the morn.”</p>

<p>222. “It will,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>223. “If I had only kent her langer,”
continued Sam’l.</p>

<p>224. “It wid hae been safer,” said
Sanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flower.</div>

<p>225. “Did ye see the yallow floor
in Bell’s bonnet?” asked the accepted
swain.</p>

<p>226. “Ay,” said Sanders, reluctantly.</p>

<p>227. “I’m dootin’&mdash;I’m sair dootin’
she’s but a flichty, licht-hearted crittur
after a’.”</p>

<p>228. “I had ay my suspeecions
o’t,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>229. “Ye hae kent her langer than
me,” said Sam’l.</p>

<p>230. “Yes,” said Sanders, “but
there’s nae gettin’ at the heart o’
women. Man Sam’l they’re desperate
cunnin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>231. “I’m dootin’t; I’m sair dootin’t.”</p>

<p>232. “It’ll be a warnin’ to ye,
Sam’l, no to be in sic a hurry i’ the
futur,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>233. Sam’l groaned.</p>

<p>234. “Ye’ll be gaein up to the
manse to arrange wi’ the minister
the morn’s mornin’,” continued Sanders,
in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>235. Sam’l looked wistfully at his
friend.</p>

<p>236. “I canna do’t, Sanders,” he
said, “I canna do’t.”</p>

<p>237. “Ye maun,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>238. “It’s aisy to speak,” retorted
Sam’l, bitterly.</p>

<p>239. “We have a’ oor troubles,
Sam’l,” said Sanders, soothingly,
“an’ every man maun bear his ain
burdens. Johnny Davie’s wife’s
dead, an’ he’s no repinin’.”</p>

<p>240. “Ay,” said Sam’l, “but a
death’s no a mairitch. We hae haen
deaths in our family too.”</p>

<p>241. “It may a’ be for the best,”
added Sanders, “an’ there wid be a
michty talk i’ the hale country-side
gin ye didna ging to the minister
like a man.”</p>

<p>242. “I maun hae langer to think
o’t,” said Sam’l.</p>

<p>243. “Bell’s mairitch is the morn,”
said Sanders, decisively.</p>

<p>244. Sam’l glanced up with a wild
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>245. “Sanders,” he cried.</p>

<p>246. “Sam’l?”</p>

<p>247. “Ye hae been a guid friend to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
me, Sanders, in this sair affliction.”</p>

<p>248. “Nothing ava,” said Sanders;
“dount mention’d.”</p>

<p>249. “But, Sanders, ye canna deny
but what your rinnin oot o’ the kirk
that awfu’ day was at the bottom o’d
a’.”</p>

<p>250. “It was so,” said Sanders,
bravely.</p>

<p>251. “An’ ye used to be fond o’
Bell, Sanders.”</p>

<p>252. “I dinna deny’t.”</p>

<p>253. “Sanders laddie,” said Sam’l,
bending forward and speaking in a
wheedling voice, “I aye thocht it was
you she likeit.”</p>

<p>254. “I had some sic idea mysel,”
said Sanders.</p>

<p>255. “Sanders, I canna think to
pairt twa fowk sae weel suited to
ane anither as you an’ Bell.”</p>

<p>256. “Canna ye, Sam’l?”</p>

<p>257. “She wid mak ye a guid wife,
Sanders. I hae studied her weel, and
she’s a thrifty, douce, clever lassie.
Sanders, there’s no the like o’ her.
Mony a time, Sanders, I hae said to
mysel, There’s a lass ony man micht
be prood to tak. A’body says the
same, Sanders. There’s nae risk
ava, man: nane to speak o’. Tak her,
laddie, tak her, Sanders; it’s a grand
chance, Sanders. She’s yours for the
spierin. I’ll gie her up, Sanders.”</p>

<p>258. “Will ye, though?” said Sanders.</p>

<p>259. “What d’ye think?” said
Sam’l.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>260. “If ye wid rayther,” said Sanders,
politely.</p>

<p>261. “There’s my han’ on’t,” said
Sam’l. “Bless ye, Sanders; ye’ve
been a true frien’ to me.”</p>

<p>262. Then they shook hands for
the first time in their lives; and soon
afterwards Sanders struck up the
brae to T’Nowhead.</p>

<p>263. Next morning Sanders Elshioner,
who had been very busy the
night before, put on his Sabbath
clothes and strolled up to the manse.</p>

<p>264. “But&mdash;but where is Sam’l?”
asked the minister; “I must see himself.”</p>

<p>265. “It’s a new arrangement,”
said Sanders.</p>

<p>266. “What do you mean, Sanders?”</p>

<p>267. “Bell’s to marry me,” explained
Sanders.</p>

<p>268. “But&mdash;but what does Sam’l
say?”</p>

<p>269. “He’s willin’,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>270. “And Bell?”</p>

<p>271. “She’s willin’, too. She prefers’t.”</p>

<p>272. “It is unusual,” said the
minister.</p>

<p>273. “It’s a’ richt,” said Sanders.</p>

<p>274. “Well, you know best,” said
the minister.</p>

<p>275. “You see the hoose was taen,
at ony rate,” continued Sanders.
“An I’ll juist ging in til’t instead o’
Sam’l.”</p>

<p>276. “Quite so.”</p>



<p>277. “An’ I cudna think to disappoint
the lassie.”</p>

<p>278. “Your sentiments do you
credit, Sanders,” said the minister;
“but I hope you do not enter upon
the blessed state of matrimony without
full consideration of its responsibilities.
It is a serious business,
marriage.”</p>

<p>279. “It’s a’ that,” said Sanders,
“but I’m willin’ to stan’ the risk.”</p>

<p>280. So, as soon as it could be
done, Sanders Elshioner took to
wife T’Nowhead’s Bell, and I remember
seeing Sam’l Dickie trying to
dance at the penny wedding.</p>

<p>281. Years afterwards it was said
in Thrums that Sam’l had treated
Bell badly, but he was never sure
about it himself.</p>

<p>282. “It was a near thing&mdash;a
michty near thing,” he admitted in
the square.</p>

<p>283. “They say,” some other weaver
would remark, “'at it was you
Bell liked best.”</p>

<p>284. “I d’na kin,” Sam’l would reply,
“but there’s nae doot the lassie
was fell fond o’ me. Ou, a mere
passin’ fancy’s ye micht say.”</p>

<h3>STORIES OF SETTING</h3>
</div>


<p>“Setting consists of the circumstances, material and
immaterial, in which the characters are seen to move in
the story. Its elements are time, place, occupations, and
(I lack a more expressive word) conditions.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>To be classified properly as a story of setting, a narrative
must be more than merely rich in local-color&mdash;as
the characteristic environment of a certain district, as set
forth in fiction, is often called. The true story of setting
is one in which the setting has a vital bearing on the
natures or the destinies of the characters. To be sure,
the setting of a story, like the staging of a play, has an
important part in the realistic presentation of the scene,
but setting assumes a predominating part when it actually
moves the characters to certain deciding actions, as do the
snow-storm in “The Outcasts of Poker Flat,” and the
soft light of the moon in “Moonlight.”</p>

<p>The local-color story is one which could not have been
set elsewhere without vitally changing, that is to say
destroying, the story. For example, Balzac’s “The Unknown
Masterpiece” is set almost entirely in an artist’s
studio. The story would be slain by dragging it away
from that atmosphere. But it is also a story of setting,
because, whatever internal influences also affected the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>characters, the setting influences their destinies&mdash;the
men and the women live lives as determined by their surroundings.
“Mateo Falcone,” too, is a story of setting,
but not primarily so; for while it could have happened
only in Corsica, and the local-color is singularly vivid, it
is primarily a story of human motive and action.</p>



<p>Because of the powerful effect of environment upon
character&mdash;in fiction just as in real life&mdash;the reader
often judges of coming events by the feeling of the setting.
The stage manager knows this, too, and accompanies,
or even forecasts, a moral crisis by having lights,
music, sounds, and other stage accessories harmonize with
the mood of the actors. Or, contrariwise, the tone of the
piece may best be brought out by a setting in contrast.</p>

<p>Observe how in the two stories illustrating this type
the authors never draw pictures of costumes and scenery
just for the sake of description, as beginners might do.
The setting, to Harte and Maupassant, is vitally a part
of the story, and any unnecessary detail would mar the
harmony of the whole. Too much were worse than too
little.</p>

<p>“When the characters live, move, and have their being
in the setting, the result is ‘atmosphere.’ Atmosphere is
thus an effect. It is felt, not seen. <em>Through</em> its medium
the reader must see all the action, yes, all the details of
the story. Atmosphere gives value to the tones of fiction
as in real life it does to landscape. The hills are
actually the same in cloud and in sunshine, but the eye
sees them as different through the mediate atmosphere.
And so setting and characters, perfectly adjusted, make
the reader, that is to say the beholder, see the story in
the very tones the literary artist desires. A story of the
sea has an atmosphere of its own, but the atmosphere
does not consist merely of the accurately colored picture
of sea and strand and sailor and ship and sky. The
whole story is informed with the <em>spirit</em> of the sea&mdash;its
tang clings to the garments, its winds breathe through
every passage, its wonderful lights and glooms tone the
whole story. Without it the story would be a poor thing,
bloodless and inert.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<h3>HARTE AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>Francis Bret Harte was born in Albany, New York,
August 25, 1839, of gentle parents. Abandoning his
common-school education at the age of fifteen, he followed
the lure of the gold craze to California, but neither
teaching nor mining enriched him, so in 1857 he became
a compositor on the <em>Golden Era</em>, San Francisco. He then
edited the <em>Californian</em>, and in 1864 was appointed secretary
of the branch Mint, remaining until 1870. Two
years before, however, he had become editor of the new
<em>Overland Monthly</em>, where some of his best work appeared.
This position did not prove permanent, and even
less so was that of the professorship of “recent literature”
in the University of California, for in 1871 he
removed to New York. In 1878 he became United States
Consul at Crefeld, Germany, and in 1880 was transferred
to Glasgow, Scotland, holding this post until 1885. His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>later life was spent chiefly in London, where his brilliant
talents brought him the full recognition of <em>littérateurs</em>.
He died in London, May 6, 1902.</p>


<p>Bret Harte was a poet, critic, novelist, and short-story
writer. His novels give him no such claim to fame as
do his other writings. His best-known dialect verses
are “The Society Upon the Stanislaus,” “Jim,” “Dickens
in Camp,” “Dow’s Flat,” and “Plain Language
From Truthful James” (often called “The Heathen
Chinee”). His best sketches and short-stories include
“The Luck of Roaring Camp,” “An Heiress of Red
Dog,” “Miggles,” “Tennessee’s Partner,” “M’liss,”
“The Idyl of Red Gulch,” “Brown of Calaveras,” and
“The Outcasts of Poker Flat”&mdash;which was first published
in <em>The Overland Monthly</em>, January, 1869.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If artistic repression, dramatic feeling, mingled humor
and pathos, deft character drawing, a sure sense of a
“good story,” and the ability to win the reader in spite
of himself&mdash;if the certain possession of all these are
marks of fictional genius, surely Bret Harte deserves the
name. For themes, he chose&mdash;and doubtless over-colored
at times&mdash;the people and the happenings of '49
during the gold craze, and not a few have charged him
with a fondness for heroes and heroines of undoubted
reputations&mdash;for evil. Social outcasts, they say, he
treated too tenderly. But Bret Harte himself effectively
answered this criticism when he said:</p>

<p>“When it shall be proven to him that communities are
degraded and brought to guilt and crime, suffering or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
destitution, from a predominance of this quality [too
much mercy]; when he shall see pardoned ticket-of-leave
men elbowing men of austere lives out of situation and
position, and the repentant Magdalen supplanting the
blameless virgin in society, then he will lay aside his
pen and extend his hand to the new Draconian discipline
in fiction. But until then he will, without claiming to be
a religious man or a moralist, but simply as an artist,
reverently and humbly conform to the rules laid down by
a Great Poet, who created the parable of the ‘Prodigal
Son’ and the ‘Good Samaritan,’ whose works have lasted
eighteen hundred years, and will remain when the present
writer and his generation are forgotten.”</p>

<p>The secret of the American short story is the treatment of
characteristic American life, with absolute knowledge of its
peculiarities and sympathy with its methods; with no fastidious
ignoring of its habitual expression, or the inchoate poetry that
may be found even hidden in its slang; with no moral determination
except that which may be the legitimate outcome of
the story itself; with no more elimination than may be necessary
for the artistic conception, and never from the fear of the fetich
of conventionalism. Of such is the American short story of to-day&mdash;the
germ of American literature to come.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bret Harte</span>,
<em>The Rise of the Short Story, Cornhill Magazine</em>, July, 1899.</p>

<p>He expounds an important half-truth which has been too much
neglected: that as being is greater than seeming, appearances
are often deceitful; under the most repellent exterior a soul of
goodness may exist. But if we study him over much, we may
become victims of the delusion that any person whose dress and
manners are respectable, is, to say the least, a suspicious character,
while drunken and profane ruffians are the saints of the
earth.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Walter Lewin</span>, <em>The Abuse of Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Kipling is a great man at sentiment (though we hear
more of his anti-sentimental side), but has he written a child-story
we can remember as long as “The Luck of Roaring Camp,”
or anything we shall remember as long as “The Outcasts of
Poker Flat,” or “Tennessee’s Partner”? These things are not
so exact in their “business” (to borrow a term from still another
art), but, perhaps on that very account, they remain symbols
of the human heart. They have the simplicity of classics,
a simplicity in which all unnecessary subtleties are dissolved.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard
Le Gallienne</span>, <em>Rudyard Kipling: A Criticism</em>.</p>

<p>His own style, as finally formed, leaves little to be desired;
it is clear, flexible, virile, laconic and withal graceful. Its full
meaning is given to every word, and occasionally, like all original
masters of prose, he imparts into a familiar word a racier
significance than it had possessed before. His genius is nowhere
more unmistakable than in the handling of his stories,
which is terse to the point of severity, yet wholly adequate;
everything necessary to the matter in hand is told, but with an
economy of word and phrase that betokens a powerful and radical
conception.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Julian Hawthorne</span> and <span class="smcap">Leonard Lemmon</span>,

<p>Tennessee’s Partner, John Oakhurst, Yuba Bill, Kentucky, are
as long-lived, seemingly, as any characters in nineteenth century
fiction.... What gives these characters their lasting power?
Why does that highly melodramatic tragedy in the hills above
Poker Flat, with its stagy reformations, and contrasts of black
sinner and white innocent, hold you spellbound at the thirtieth
as at the first reading? Why does Tennessee’s Partner make
you wish to grasp him by the hand? Bret Harte believed, apparently,
that it was his realism which did it.... But we do
not wait to be told by Californians, who still remember the red-shirt
period, that Roaring Camp is not realism.... Not the
realism, but the idealization, of this life of the Argonauts was
the prize Bret Harte gained.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry S. Canby</span>, <em>The Short Story

<h3>THE OUTCASTS OF POKER FLAT</h3>

<p class="big05 center">BY BRET HARTE</p>

<div class="sidenote">Central character.</div>

<p>As Mr. John Oakhurst, gambler,
stepped into the main street of Poker
Flat on the morning of the
twenty-third of November, 1850, he
was conscious of a change in its <span class="sidenote">Crisis at once forecasted.</span>
moral atmosphere since the preceding
night. Two or three men, conversing
earnestly together, ceased as
he approached, and exchanged significant <span class="sidenote">Preliminary setting.</span>
glances. There was a Sabbath
lull in the air, which, in a
settlement unused to Sabbath influences,
looked ominous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Physical delineation interwoven
with the progress
of the story.</div>

<p>2. Mr. Oakhurst’s calm, handsome
face betrayed small concern of these
indications. Whether he was conscious
of any predisposing cause,
was another question. “I reckon <span class="sidenote">Summary of tone of the
fundamental situation.
<span class="smcap">Foundation Crisis</span>.</span>
they’re after somebody,” he reflected;
“likely it’s me.” He returned to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
pocket the handkerchief with which
he had been whipping away the red
dust of Poker Flat from his neat
boots, and quietly discharged his
mind of any further conjecture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Situation explained.</div>

<p>3. In point of fact, Poker Flat was
“after somebody.” It had lately
suffered the loss of several thousand
dollars, two valuable horses, and a
prominent citizen. It was experiencing
a spasm of virtuous reaction,
quite as lawless and ungovernable as
any of the acts that had provoked it. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Foundation Plot Incident.</span></span>
A secret committee had determined
to rid the town of all improper persons.
This was done permanently in
regard to two men who were then
hanging from the boughs of a sycamore
in the gulch, and temporarily in
the banishment of certain other objectionable
characters. I regret to
say that some of these were ladies.<span class="sidenote">Euphemism.</span>
It is but due to the sex, however, to
state that their impropriety was professional,
and it was only in such
easily established standards of evil
that Poker Flat ventured to sit in
judgment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the author’s slight
ironic tone, which later
gives way to simple
pathos.</div>

<p>4. Mr. Oakhurst was right in supposing
that he was included in this
category. A few of the committee
had urged hanging him as a possible
example, and a sure method of
reimbursing themselves from his
pockets of the sums he had won
from them. “It’s agin justice,” said
Jim Wheeler, “to let this yer young
man from Roaring Camp&mdash;an entire
stranger&mdash;carry away our money.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
But a crude sentiment of equity residing
in the breasts of those who had
been fortunate enough to win from
Mr. Oakhurst overruled this narrower
local prejudice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character delineation.</div>

<p>5. Mr. Oakhurst received his sentence
with philosophic calmness, none
the less coolly that he was aware of
the hesitation of his judges. He was
too much of a gambler not to accept
Fate. With him life was at best an
uncertain game, and he recognized
the usual percentage in favor of the
dealer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First group of characters.</div>

<p>6. A body of armed men accompanied
the deported wickedness of
Poker Flat to the outskirts of the
settlement. Besides Mr. Oakhurst,
who was known to be a coolly desperate
man, and for whose intimidation
the armed escort was intended,
the expatriated party consisted of a
young woman familiarly known as
“The Duchess”; another, who had <span class="sidenote">First group of characters.</span>
gained the infelicitous title of “Mother
Shipton”; and “Uncle Billy,” a
suspected sluice-robber and confirmed
drunkard. <span class="sidenote">Climax of first crisis.</span>The cavalcade provoked
no comments from the spectators,
nor was any word uttered by the
escort. <span class="sidenote">End of Introduction and
groundwork.</span>Only, when the gulch which
marked the uttermost limit of Poker
Flat was reached, the leader spoke
briefly and to the point. The exiles
were forbidden to return at the peril
of their lives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Third Stage of First Plot
Incident.</span><br />
Is “their” well used?</div>

<p>7. As the escort disappeared, their
pent-up feelings found vent in a few
hysterical tears from the Duchess,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
some bad language from Mother
Shipton, and a Parthian volley of expletives
from Uncle Billy. The philosophic
Oakhurst alone remained
silent. He listened calmly to Mother
Shipton’s desire to cut somebody’s
heart out, to the repeated statements
of the Duchess that she would die in the
road, and to the alarming oaths
that seemed to be bumped out of
Uncle Billy as he rode forward.<span class="sidenote">Paragraph of character delineation.</span>
With the easy good-humor characteristic
of his class, he insisted upon
exchanging his own riding-horse,
“Five Spot,” for the sorry mule
which the Duchess rode. But even
this act did not draw the party into
any closer sympathy. The young
woman readjusted her somewhat
draggled plumes with a feeble, faded
coquetry; Mother Shipton eyed
the possessor of “Five Spot” with
malevolence, and Uncle Billy included
the whole party in one sweeping
anathema.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second preliminary setting.</div>


<p>8. The road to Sandy Bar&mdash;a
camp that, not having as yet experienced
the regenerating influences
of Poker Flat, consequently seemed
to offer some invitation to the emigrants&mdash;lay
over a steep mountain
range. It was distant a day’s severe
journey. In that advanced season,
the party soon passed out of the
moist, temperate regions of the foothills
into the dry, cold, bracing air
of the Sierras. The trail was narrow
and difficult. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Foundation for Main Crisis.</span></span> At noon the
Duchess, rolling out of her saddle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
upon the ground, declared her intention
of going no further, and the
party halted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Main Setting.</span></div>

<p>9. The spot was singularly wild
and impressive. A wooded amphitheatre,
surrounded on three sides
by precipitous cliffs of naked granite,
sloped gently toward the crest of
another precipice that overlooked the
valley. It was, undoubtedly, the
most suitable spot for a camp, had
camping been advisable. But Mr.
Oakhurst knew that scarcely half
the journey to Sandy Bar was accomplished,
and the party were not
equipped or provisioned for delay.
This fact he pointed out to his companions
curtly, with a philosophic
commentary on the folly of “throwing
up their hand before the game
was played out.” But they were
furnished with liquor, which in this
emergency stood them in place of
food, fuel, rest, and prescience. In
spite of his remonstrances, it was
not long before they were more or
less under its influence. <span class="sidenote">Character contrasts.</span>Uncle Billy
passed rapidly from a bellicose state
into one of stupor, the Duchess became
maudlin, and Mother Shipton
snored. Mr. Oakhurst alone remained
erect, leaning against a rock,
calmly surveying them.</p>


<div class="sidenote">Setting in harmony with
tone of story.</div>

<p>10. Mr. Oakhurst did not drink.
It interfered with a profession which
required coolness, impassiveness and
presence of mind, and, in his own
language, he “couldn’t afford it.”
As he gazed at his recumbent fellow-exiles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
the loneliness begotten of his
pariah-trade, his habits of life, his
very vices, for the first time seriously
oppressed him. He bestirred himself
in dusting his black clothes,
washing his hands and face, and
other acts characteristic of his
studiously neat habits, and for a
moment forgot his annoyance. The
thought of deserting his weaker and
more pitiable companions never perhaps
occurred to him. Yet he could
not help feeling the want of that excitement
which, singularly enough,
was most conducive to that calm
equanimity for which he was notorious.
He looked at the gloomy walls
that rose a thousand feet sheer above
the circling pines around him; at the
sky, ominously clouded; at the valley
below, already deepening into shadow.
And, doing so, suddenly he
heard his own name called.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Second group of characters.</div>

<p>11. A horseman slowly ascended
the trail. In the fresh, open face of
the newcomer Mr. Oakhurst recognized
Tom Simson, otherwise known
as “The Innocent” of Sandy Bar.
He had met him some months before
over a “little game,” and had, with
perfect equanimity, won the entire
fortune&mdash;amounting to some forty
dollars&mdash;of that guileless youth. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Opening of Main Plot
Situation.</span></span>
After the game was finished, Mr.
Oakhurst drew the youthful speculator
behind the door and thus addressed
him: “Tommy, you’re a
good little man, but you can’t gamble
worth a cent. Don’t try it over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
again.” He then handed him his
money back, pushed him gently from
the room, and so made a devoted
slave of Tom Simson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Character Contrasts.</div>

<p>12. There was a remembrance of
this in his boyish and enthusiastic
greeting of Mr. Oakhurst. He had
started, he said, to go to Poker Flat
to seek his fortune. “Alone?” No,
not exactly alone; in fact (a giggle),
he had run away with Piney Woods.
Didn’t Mr. Oakhurst remember
Piney? She that used to wait on the
table at the Temperance House?
They had been engaged a long time,
but old Jake Woods had objected,
and so they ran away, and were going
to Poker Flat to be married, and
here they were. And they were
tired out, and how lucky it was they
had found a place to camp, and company.
All this the Innocent delivered
rapidly, while Piney, a stout,
comely damsel of fifteen, emerged
from behind the pine-tree, where she
had been blushing unseen, and rode
to the side of her lover.</p>

<div class="sidenote">First effect of the newcomers
on the tone of the
first group of characters.
This furnishes the <em>motif</em>
for the story.</div>

<p>13. Mr. Oakhurst seldom troubled
himself with sentiment, still less with
propriety; but he had a vague idea
that the situation was not felicitous.
He retained, however, his presence of
mind sufficiently to kick Uncle Billy,
who was about to say something, and
Uncle Billy was sober enough to
recognize in Mr. Oakhurst’s kick a
superior power that would not bear
trifling. He then endeavored to dissuade
Tom Simson from delaying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
further, but in vain. He even pointed
out the fact that there was no
provision, nor means of making a
camp. But, unluckily, the Innocent
met this objection by assuring the
party that he was provided with an
extra mule loaded with provisions,
and by the discovery of a rude attempt
at a log-house near the trail.
“Piney can stay with Mrs. Oakhurst,”
said the Innocent, pointing
to the Duchess, “and I can shift for
myself.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Further effect.</div>


<p id="par14">14. Nothing but Mr. Oakhurst’s
admonishing foot saved Uncle Billy
from bursting into a roar of laughter.
As it was, he felt compelled to retire
up the cañon until he could recover
his gravity. There he confided the
joke to the tall pine-trees, with many
slaps of his leg, contortions of his
face, and the usual profanity. But
when he returned to the party, he
found them seated by a fire&mdash;for the
air had grown strangely chill and the
sky overcast&mdash;in apparently amicable
conversation. Piney was actually
talking in an impulsive, girlish
fashion to the Duchess, who was
listening with an interest and animation
she had not shown for many
days. The Innocent was holding
forth, apparently with equal effect, to
Mr. Oakhurst and Mother Shipton,
who was actually relaxing into
amiability. “Is this yer a d&mdash;d
picnic?” said Uncle Billy, with inward
scorn, as he surveyed the
sylvan group, the glancing firelight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
and the tethered animals in the foreground.<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Foundation for Main Crisis&mdash;not
yet apparent.</span></span>
Suddenly an idea mingled
with the alcoholic fumes that disturbed
his brain. It was apparently
of a jocular nature, for he felt impelled
to slap his leg again and cram
his fist into his mouth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Local color.</div>

<p>15. As the shadows crept slowly
up the mountain, a slight breeze
rocked the tops of the pine-trees, and
moaned through their long and
gloomy aisles. The ruined cabin,
patched and covered with pine-boughs,
was set apart for the ladies.
As the lovers parted, they unaffectedly
exchanged a parting kiss, so honest
and sincere that it might have been
heard above the swaying pines. The
frail Duchess and the malevolent
Mother Shipton were probably too
stunned to remark upon this last evidence
of simplicity, and so turned
without a word to the hut. The fire
was replenished, the men lay down
before the door, and in a few minutes
were asleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Change&mdash;approach of main
crisis.</div>

<p>16. Mr. Oakhurst was a light sleeper.
Toward morning he awoke benumbed
and cold. As he stirred the
dying fire, the wind, which was now
blowing strongly, brought to his
cheek that which caused the blood to
leave it&mdash;snow!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forecasted in <a href="#par14">¶14</a>.</div>

<p>17. He started to his feet with the
intention of awakening the sleepers,
for there was no time to lose. But
turning to where Uncle Billy had
been lying, he found him gone. A
suspicion leaped to his brain and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
curse to his lips. He ran to the spot
where the mules had been tethered;
they were no longer there. The
tracks were already rapidly disappearing
in the snow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tone of character.</div>


<p>18. The momentary excitement
brought Mr. Oakhurst back to the
fire with his usual calm. He did not
waken the sleepers. The Innocent
slumbered peacefully, with a smile on
his good-humored, freckled face; the
virgin Piney slept beside her frailer <span class="sidenote">Contrast with crisis.
Note casual physical description.</span>
sisters as sweetly as though attended
by celestial guardians, and Mr. Oakhurst,
drawing his blanket over his
shoulders, stroked his mustaches and
waited for the dawn. It came slowly <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Main Plot Incident</span>&mdash;What
follows is its outgrowth.</span>
in a whirling mist of snow-flakes,
that dazzled and confused the eye.
What could be seen of the landscape
appeared magically changed.<span class="sidenote">Crisis acute.</span>
 He
looked over the valley, and summoned
up the present and future in two
words,&mdash;“snowed in!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">As the story progresses note
how the physical crises
and the moral crises keep
pace.</div>

<p>19. A careful inventory of the
provisions, which, fortunately for the
party, had been stored within the
hut, and so escaped the felonious
fingers of Uncle Billy, disclosed the
fact that with care and prudence they
might last ten days longer. “That
is,” said Mr. Oakhurst, <em>sotto voce</em> to
the Innocent, “if you’re willing to
board us. If you ain’t&mdash;and perhaps
you’d better not&mdash;you can wait till
Uncle Billy gets back with provisions.”
For some occult reason, Mr.
Oakhurst could not bring himself to
disclose Uncle Billy’s rascality, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
so offered the hypothesis that he had
wandered from the camp and had accidentally
stampeded the animals.
He dropped a warning to the
Duchess and Mother Shipton, who of
course knew the facts of their associate’s
defection. “They’ll find out
the truth about us <em>all</em> when they find
out anything,” he added, significantly,
“and there’s no good frightening
them now.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lull in crisis.</div>

<p>20. Tom Simson not only put all
his worldly store at the disposal of
Mr. Oakhurst, but seemed to enjoy
the prospect of their enforced seclusion.
“We’ll have a good camp for
a week, and then the snow’ll melt,
and we’ll all go back together.” The <span class="sidenote">From this point the story
develops gradually and by
closely knit incidents in
direct succession, all
growing out of the setting,
which furnishes the
physical crisis.</span>
cheerful gayety of the young man,
and Mr. Oakhurst’s calm infected
the others. The Innocent, with the
aid of pine-boughs, extemporized a
thatch for the roofless cabin, and the
Duchess directed Piney in the rearrangement
of the interior with a
taste and tact that opened the blue
eyes of that provincial maiden to
their fullest extent. “I reckon now
you’re used to fine things at Poker
Flat,” said Piney. The Duchess
turned away sharply to conceal
something that reddened her cheek
through its professional tint, and
Mother Shipton requested Piney not
to “chatter.” <span class="sidenote">Pseudo crisis.</span>But when Mr. Oakhurst
returned from a weary search
for the trail, he heard the sound of
happy laughter echoed from the
rocks. He stopped in some alarm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
and his thoughts first naturally
reverted to the whiskey, which he
had prudently <em>cachéd</em>. “And yet it
don’t somehow sound like whiskey,”
said the gambler. <span class="sidenote">Resolution of pseudo crisis.</span>It was not until
he caught sight of the blazing fire
through the still blinding storm and
the group around it that he settled to
the conviction that it was “square
fun.”</p>


<p>21. Whether Mr. Oakhurst had
<em>cachéd</em> his cards with the whiskey as
something debarred the free access
of the community, I cannot say. <span class="sidenote">Contrast with the actual
danger.</span> It
was certain that, in Mother Shipton’s
words, he “didn’t say cards
once” during the evening. Haply the
time was beguiled by an accordion,
produced somewhat ostentatiously by
Tom Simson from his pack. Notwithstanding
some difficulties attending
the manipulation of his instrument, <span class="sidenote">Contrast is the author’s
main reliance in this
story.</span>
Piney Woods managed to
pluck several reluctant melodies from
its keys, to an accompaniment by the
Innocent on a pair of bone castanets.
But the crowning festivity of the
evening was reached in a rude camp-meeting <span class="sidenote">Contrast with character-habits.
A hint of character
change.</span>
hymn, which the lovers, joining
hands, sang with great earnestness
and vociferation. I fear that a
certain defiant tone and Covenanter’s
swing to its chorus, <span class="sidenote">Is “Covenanter’s” well
used?</span> rather than any
devotional quality, caused it speedily
to infect the others, who at last joined
in the refrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container p11 pw20">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="small1">“I’m proud to live in the service of the Lord,<br />
And I’m bound to die in His army.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>22. The pines rocked, the storm
eddied and whirled above the miserable
group, and the flames of their
altar leaped heavenward, as if in
token of the vow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hope.</div>

<p>23. At midnight the storm abated,
the rolling clouds parted, and the
stars glittered keenly above the sleeping
camp. Mr. Oakhurst, whose professional
habits had enabled him to
live on the smallest possible amount
of sleep, in dividing the watch with
Tom Simson, somehow managed to
take upon himself the greater part of
that duty. <span class="sidenote">Character revelation.</span>He excused himself to
the Innocent, by saying that he had
“often been a week without sleep.”
“Doing what?” asked Tom. “Poker!”
replied Oakhurst, sententiously;
“when a man gets a streak of luck,&mdash;nigger-luck,&mdash;he
don’t get tired.
The luck gives in first. Luck,” continued
the gambler, reflectively, “is
a mighty queer thing. All you know
about it for certain is that it’s bound
to change. And it’s finding out when
it’s going to change that makes you.
We’ve had a streak of bad luck since
we left Poker Flat,&mdash;you come along,
and slap you get into it, too. If you
can hold your cards right along,
you’re all right. For,” added the
gambler, with cheerful irrelevance:&mdash;</p>

</div>


<div class="sidenote">Note the union of setting
with the progress of the

<p>24. The third day came, and the
sun, looking through the white-curtained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
valley, saw the outcasts
divide their slowly decreasing store
of provisions for the morning meal.
It was one of the peculiarities of that
mountain climate that its rays diffused
a kindly warmth over the wintry
landscape, as if in regretful commiseration
of the past. <span class="sidenote">Contrast.</span>But it revealed
drift on drift of snow piled high
around the hut,&mdash;a hopeless, uncharted,
trackless sea of white lying below
the rocky shores to which the cast-aways
still clung. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Key to Setting</span>.</span>Through the
marvellously clear air the smoke of
the pastoral village of Poker Flat
rose miles away. Mother Shipton
saw it, and from a remote pinnacle
of her rocky fastness, hurled in that
direction a final malediction. <span class="sidenote">Character change&mdash;a key
passage.</span>It was
her last vituperative attempt, and
perhaps for that reason was invested
with a certain degree of sublimity.
It did her good, she privately informed
the Duchess. “Just you go
out there and cuss, and see.” <span class="sidenote">Contributory incident.</span>She
then set herself to the task of amusing
“the child,” as she and the
Duchess were pleased to call Piney.
Piney was no chicken, but it was a
soothing and ingenious theory of the
pair thus to account for the fact that
she didn’t swear and wasn’t improper.</p>



<p>25. When night crept up again
through the gorges, the reedy notes
of the accordion rose and fell in fitful
spasms and long-drawn gasps by
the flickering camp-fire. But music
failed to fill entirely the aching void<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
left by insufficient food, and a new
diversion was proposed by Piney,&mdash;story-telling.
Neither Mr. Oakhurst
nor his female companions caring to
relate their personal experiences, this
plan would have failed, too, but for
the Innocent. Some months before
he had chanced upon a stray copy of
Mr. Pope’s ingenious translation of
the Iliad. <span class="sidenote">Developing or contributory
incident.</span>He now proposed to narrate
the principal incidents of that
poem&mdash;having thoroughly mastered
the argument and fairly forgotten the
words&mdash;in the current vernacular of
Sandy Bar. And so for the rest of
that night the Homeric demigods
again walked the earth. Trojan
bully and wily Greek wrestled in the
winds, and the great pines in the
cañon seemed to bow to the wrath
of the son of Peleus. Mr. Oakhurst
listened with quiet satisfaction.
Most especially was he interested in
the fate of “Ash-heels,” as the Innocent
persisted in denominating the
“swift-footed Achilles.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note upward and downward
movement&mdash;alternations
of hope and despair, but a
gradual deepening of the
crisis.<br />
Note the contrast between
the epithet “outcasts”
and the feeling with
which they are now invested.</div>

<p>26. So with small food and much
of Homer and the accordion, a week
passed over the heads of the outcasts.
The sun again forsook them, and
again from leaden skies the snow-flakes
were sifted over the land. Day
by day closer around them drew the
snowy circle, until at last they looked
from their prison over drifted
walls of dazzling white, that towered
twenty feet above their heads.
It became more and more difficult to
replenish their fires, even from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
fallen trees beside them, now half
hidden in the drifts. And yet no one
complained. The lovers turned from
the dreary prospect and looked into
each other’s eyes, and were happy. <span class="sidenote">Character progress.</span>
Mr. Oakhurst settled himself coolly
to the losing game before him. The
Duchess, more cheerful than she had
been, assumed the care of Piney.<span class="sidenote">Hint of later character revelation.</span>
Only Mother Shipton&mdash;once the
strongest of the party&mdash;seemed to
sicken and fade. At midnight on the
tenth day she called Oakhurst to her
side. “I’m going,” she said, in a
voice of querulous weakness, “but
don’t say anything about it. Don’t
waken the kids. Take the bundle
from under my head and open it.”
Mr. Oakhurst did so. It contained
Mother Shipton’s rations for the last
week, untouched. “Give ’em to the
child,” she said, pointing to the sleeping
Piney. “You’ve starved yourself,”
said the gambler. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Character Climax.</span></span>“That’s
what they call it,” said the woman,
querulously, as she lay down again,
and, turning her face to the wall,
passed quietly away.</p>


<p>27. The accordion and the bones
were put aside that day, and Homer
was forgotten. When the body of
Mother Shipton had been committed
to the snow, Mr. Oakhurst took the
Innocent aside, and showed him a
pair of snow-shoes, which he had
fashioned from the old pack-saddle.<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Plot Incident.</span></span>
“There’s one chance in a hundred to
save her yet,” he said, pointing to
Piney; “but it’s there,” he added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
pointing toward Poker Flat. “If you
can reach there in two days she’s
safe.” “And you?” asked Tom
Simson. “I’ll stay here,” was the
curt reply.</p>


<p>28. The lovers parted with a long
embrace. “You are not going, too?”
said the Duchess, as she saw Mr.
Oakhurst apparently waiting to accompany
him. <span class="sidenote">Preparation for climax.</span>“As far as the cañon,”
he replied. He turned suddenly,
and kissed the Duchess, leaving her
pallid face aflame, and her trembling
limbs rigid with amazement.</p>

<p>29. Night came, but not Mr. Oakhurst.
It brought the storm again
and the whirling snow. Then the
Duchess, feeding the fire, found that
some one had quietly piled beside
the hut enough fuel to last a few days
longer. The tears rose to her eyes,
but she hid them from Piney.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Characters in full change.</div>

<p>30. The women slept but little. In
the morning, looking into each other’s
faces, they read their fate. Neither
spoke; but Piney, accepting the position
of the stronger, drew near and
placed her arm around the Duchess’s

<span class="sidenote">Note the repression of
this entire climax. Simple,
quiet sentences are
enough.</span>

waist. They kept this attitude
for the rest of the day. That night
the storm reached its greatest fury,
and, rending asunder the protecting
pines, invaded the very hut.</p>



<p>31. Toward morning they found
themselves unable to feed the fire,
which gradually died away. As the
embers slowly blackened, the Duchess
crept closer to Piney, and broke
the silence of many hours: “Piney,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
can you pray?”<span class="sidenote">No melodrama here.</span> “No, dear,” said
Piney, simply. The Duchess, without
knowing exactly why, felt relieved,
and putting her head upon
Piney’s shoulder, spoke no more.<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Second Character Climax.</span></span>
And so reclining, the younger and
purer pillowing the head of her soiled
sister upon her virgin breast, they
fell asleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Local color in harmony with
spirit of story.</div>

<p>32. The wind lulled as if it feared
to waken them. Feathery drifts of
snow, shaken from the long pine-boughs,
flew like white-winged birds,
and settled about them as they slept.
The moon through the rifted clouds
looked down upon what had been
the camp. <span class="sidenote">Symbolism of physical nature.</span>But all human stain, all
trace of earthly travail, was hidden
beneath the spotless mantle mercifully
flung from above.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poetic euphemism.</div>

<p>33. They slept all that day and the
next, nor did they waken when voices
and footsteps broke the silence of
the camp. And when pitying fingers
brushed the snow from their wan
faces, you could scarcely have told
from the equal peace that dwelt upon
them, which was she that had sinned.
Even the law of Poker Flat recognized
this, and turned away, leaving
them still locked in each other’s
arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Main Character Climax,
and Denouement.</span></div>

<p>34. But at the head of the gulch,
on one of the largest pine-trees, they
found the deuce of clubs pinned to
the bark with a bowie-knife. It bore
the following, written in pencil, in
a firm hand:&mdash;</p>

<h3>MAUPASSANT AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>Henri René Albert Guy de Maupassant was born in
Normandy, France, in 1850. In that picturesque region
he passed his youth, and returned thither for frequent
sojourns in later life. Having finished his studies, he
became an employé in the government service in Paris.
This experience, his love for athletics, and his recollections
of the Franco-Prussian war, he turned to good
account in his fictional work. His literary education was
conducted by Gustave Flaubert, his uncle and god-father,
under whom he served so rigid an apprenticeship that
when he produced his first short-story, “Tallow Ball”
(<em>Boule de Suif</em>), his preceptor pronounced it a masterpiece,
as indeed it is. He died in 1893, at the age of
43, by his own hand, his reason having failed after some
years of increasing depression and gloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>Though his productive period covered only ten years,
Guy de Maupassant has left several notable novels, some
fair poetry, and a large number of remarkable short-stories.
Most of his work deals more frankly with the
sordid side of life than American society approves, but
many of his short-stories are unexceptionable. Among
the best of these are “The Necklace,” “The Horla,”
“Happiness,” “Vain Beauty,” “A Coward,” “A Ghost,”
“Little Soldier,” “The Wolf,” “Moonlight,” and “The
Piece of String.”</p>

<p>Technically, Maupassant was the most finished short-story
writer of all; but he lacked spiritual power, and so
he himself missed much of the world’s beauty, and disclosed
but little to others. Rarely can the reader feel the
least throb of sympathy of the author for his characters.
Technically flawless, his work is too often cold, and the
warm ideals of a tender heart are chiefly absent. An
inflexible realist, he pressed his method farther than did
Flaubert, a really strong novelist. From life’s raw materials
Maupassant wove incomparably brilliant fiction-fabrics,
equally distinguished for plot, characterization,
and style; but it cannot be said that he interpreted life
with a wholesome, uplifting spirit.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Happy are they whom life satisfies, who can amuse themselves,
and be content ... who have not discovered, with a vast disgust,
... that all things are a weariness.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Guy de Maupassant.</span></p>

<p>He who destroys the ideal destroys himself. In art and in
life Maupassant lived in the lower order of facts, the brutal
world of events unrelated to a spiritual order. He drained his
senses of the last power of sensation and reaction; he plunged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
headlong into the sensual life upon which they opened when
the luminous heaven above the material world was obliterated.
Madness always lies that way as a matter of physiology as well
as of morals, and Maupassant went the tragic way of the sensualist
since time began.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hamilton W. Mabie</span>, in <em>The Outlook</em>.</p>


<p>Maupassant saw life with his senses, and he reflected on it in
a purely animal revolt, the recoil of the hurt animal. His observation
is not, as it has been hastily assumed to be, cold; it is
as superficially emotional as that of the average sensual man,
and its cynicism is only another, not less superficial, kind of feeling.
He saw life in all its details, and his soul was entangled
in the details. He saw it without order, without recompense,
without pity; he saw it too clearly to be duped by appearances,
and too narrowly to distinguish any light beyond what seemed
to him the enclosing bounds of darkness.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Arthur Symons</span>,
<em>Studies in Prose and Verse</em>.</p>

<p>He has produced a hundred short tales and only four regular
novels; but if the tales deserve the first place in any candid
appreciation of his talent it is not simply because they are so
much the more numerous: they are also more characteristic;
they represent him best in his originality, and their brevity, extreme
in some cases, does not prevent them from being a collection
of masterpieces.... What they have most in common
is their being extremely strong, and after that their being extremely
brutal.... M. de Maupassant sees human life as a
terribly ugly business relieved by the comical, but even the
comedy is for the most part the comedy of misery, of avidity,
of ignorance, helplessness, and grossness.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry James</span>, <em>Partial
Portraits</em>.</p>


<p>His short-stories are masterpieces of the art of story-telling,
because he had a Greek sense of form, a Latin power of construction,
and a French felicity of style. They are simple, most
of them; direct, swift, inevitable, and inexorable in their straightforward
movement. If art consists in the suppression of non-essentials,
there have been few greater artists in fiction than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
Maupassant. In his Short-stories there is never a word wasted,
and there is never an excursus. Nor is there any feebleness or
fumbling. What he wanted to do he did, with the unerring
certainty of Leatherstocking, hitting the bull’s-eye again and
again. He had the abundance and the ease of the very great
artists; and the half-dozen or the half-score of his best stories
are among the very best Short-stories in any language.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Brander
Matthews</span>, <em>The Philosophy of the Short-Story</em>.</p>

<p>His firm, alert prose is so profoundly French, free from neologisms,
strong in verbs, sober in adjectives, every sentence standing
out with no apparent effort, no excess, like a muscle in the
perfect body of a young athlete.... He has that sense of the
real which so many naturalists lack, and which the care for
exact detail does not replace.... His predilection for ordinary
scenes and ordinary types is everywhere evident; he uses all
kinds of settings,&mdash;a café, a furnished room, a farmyard, seen
in their actual character without poetic transfiguration, with all
their vulgarity, their poverty, their ugliness. And he uses, too,
all kinds of characters,&mdash;clerks, peasants of Normandy, petty
bourgeois of Paris and of the country. They live the empty,
tragic, or grotesque hours of their lives; are sometimes touching,
sometimes odious; and never achieve greatness either in heroism
or in wickedness.</p>

<p>They are not gay, these stories; and the kind of amusement
they afford is strongly mixed with irony, pity, and contempt.
Gayety, whether brutal, frank, mocking, or delicate, never leaves
this bitter taste in the heart. How pitiful in its folly, in its
vanity, in its weakness, is the humanity which loves, weeps, or
agitates in the tales of Maupassant! There, virtue if awkward
is never recompensed, nor vice if skillful punished; mothers are
not always saints, nor sons always grateful and respectful; the
guilty are often ignorant of remorse. Then are these beings
immoral? To tell the truth, they are guided by their instincts,
by events, submissive to the laws of necessity, and apparently
released by the author from all responsibility.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Firmin Roz</span>,
<em>Guy de Maupassant</em>, in <span class="smcap">Warner’s</span> <em>Library of the World’s Best
Literature</em>.</p>

<h3>MOONLIGHT</h3>

<p class="p2 small1 center">(CLAIR DE LUNE)</p>

<p class="big05 center">BY GUY DE MAUPASSANT</p>

<p class="center"><em>Translation by The Editor</em><a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The Abbé Marignan bore well his
title of Soldier of the Church. He
was a tall priest, and spare; fanatical,
perpetually in a state of spiritual exaltation,
but upright of soul. His
every belief was settled, without even
a thought of wavering. He imagined
sincerely that he understood
his God thoroughly, that he penetrated
His designs, His will, His
purposes.</p>

<p>2. As with long strides he promenaded
the garden walk of his little
country presbytery, sometimes a question
would arise in his mind: “Why
did God create that?” And, mentally
taking the place of God, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>searched obstinately for the answer&mdash;and
nearly always found it. It
would not have been like him to murmur,
in an outburst of pious humility:
“O Lord, thy designs are impenetrable!”
Rather might he say to himself:
“I am the servant of God; I
ought to know the reasons for what
He does, or, if I know them not, I
ought to divine them.”</p>

<p>3. To him all nature seemed created
with a logic as absolute as it was admirable.
The “wherefore” and the
“because” always corresponded perfectly.
Dawn was made to gladden
our waking, the day to ripen the
crops, the rain to water them, the
evening to prepare for slumber, and
the night was darkened for sleep.</p>

<p>4. The four seasons met perfectly
all the needs of agriculture; and to
the priest it was quite inconceivable
that nature had no designs, and that,
on the contrary, all living things were
subjects of the same inexorable laws
of period, climate, and matter.</p>

<p>5. But he did hate woman! He
hated her unconscionably, and by instinct
held her in contempt. Often
did he repeat the words of Christ,
“Woman, what have I to do with
thee?” And he would add, “One
might think that God Himself did
not feel quite content with this one
work of his hands!” To him, indeed,
woman was the child twelve
times unclean of whom the poet
speaks. She was the temptress who
had ensnared the first man, and who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
constantly kept up her work of damnation&mdash;she
was a feeble, dangerous,
and mysteriously troublous creature.
And even more than her accursed
body did he hate her loving spirit.</p>

<p>6. He had often felt that women
were regarding him tenderly, and
even though he knew himself to be
invulnerable, it exasperated him to
recognize that need for loving which
fluttered ever-present in their hearts.</p>

<p>7. In his opinion, God had created
woman only to tempt man and to test
him. She should never be even approached
without those defensive
measures which one would take, and
those fears which one would harbor,
when nearing a trap. In fact, she
was precisely like a trap, with her
lips open and arms extended towards
man.</p>

<p>8. Only toward nuns did he exercise
any indulgence, for they were rendered
harmless by their vow. But
he treated them harshly just the same,
because, ever-living in the depths of
their pent-up and humble hearts, he
discerned that everlasting tenderness
which constantly surged up toward
him, priest though he was.</p>

<p>9. Of all this he was conscious in
their upturned glances, more limpid
with pious feeling than the looks of
monks; in the spiritual exaltations in
which their sex indulged; in their
ecstasies of love toward Christ,
which made the priest indignant because
it was really woman’s love,
carnal love. Of this detestable tenderness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
he was conscious, too, in
their very docility, in the gentleness
of their voices when they addressed
him, in their downcast eyes, and in
their submissive tears when he rudely
rebuked them.</p>

<p>10. So he would shake his cassock
when he left the convent door, and
stride off, stretching his legs as if
fleeing before some danger.</p>

<p>11. Now the abbé had a niece who
lived with her mother in a little
house near by. He was determined
to make of her a sister of charity.</p>

<p>12. She was pretty, giddy, and a
born tease. When he preached at her,
she laughed; and when he became
angry with her, she kissed him vehemently,
pressing him to her bosom,
while he would instinctively seek to
disengage himself from this embrace&mdash;which,
all the same, gave him a
thrill of exquisite joy, awaking deep
within his soul that feeling of fatherhood
which slumbers in every man.</p>

<p>13. Often as they walked together
along the foot-paths through the
fields, he would talk with her of
God, of his God; but she scarcely
heard him, for she was looking at
the sky, the grass, the flowers, with
a joy of life which beamed from her
eyes. Sometimes she would dart
away to catch some flying creature,
crying as she brought it back: “See,
my uncle, how pretty it is; I should
like to kiss it.” And that passion to
kiss insects, or lilac flowers, disturbed,
irritated, and repelled the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
priest, who recognized even in that
longing the ineradicable love which
blooms perennial in the heart of
woman.</p>

<p>14. And now one day the sacristan’s
wife, who was the Abbé Marignan’s
housekeeper, cautiously told him that
his niece had a lover!</p>

<p>15. He was dreadfully shocked, and
stood gasping for breath, lather all
over his face, for he was shaving.</p>

<p>16. When at length he was able to
think and speak, he cried: “It is not
true. You are lying, Mélanie!”</p>

<p>17. But the peasant woman laid her
hand over her heart: “May our
Lord judge me if I am lying, <em>monsieur
le curé</em>. I tell you she goes out
to meet him every night as soon as
your sister is in bed. They meet each
other down by the river. You need
only go there between ten o’clock and
midnight to see for yourself.”</p>

<p>18. He stopped rubbing his chin
and began pacing the room violently,
as was his custom in times of serious
thought. When at length he did try
to finish his shaving he cut himself
three times, from nose to ear.</p>

<p>19. All day long he was silent,
though almost exploding with indignation
and wrath. To his priestly
rage against the power of love was
now added the indignation of a spiritual
father, of a teacher, of the guardian
of souls, who has been deceived,
robbed, and trifled with by a mere
child. He felt that egotistical suffocation
which parents experience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
when their daughter tells them that
she has selected a husband without
their advice and in defiance of their
wishes.</p>

<p>20. After dinner he tried to read a
little, but he could not&mdash;he grew
more and more exasperated. When
the clock struck ten, he grasped his
cane, a formidable oaken club which
he always carried when he went out
at night to visit the sick. With a
smile he examined this huge cudgel,
gripped it in his solid, countryman’s
fist, and flourished it menacingly in
the air. Then, suddenly, with grinding
teeth, he brought it down upon
a chair-back, which fell splintered to
the floor.</p>

<p>21. He opened his door to go out;
but paused upon the threshold, surprised
by such a glory of moonlight
as one rarely sees.</p>

<p>22. And as he was endowed with
an exalted soul of such a sort as the
Fathers of the Church, those poetic
seers, must have possessed, he became
suddenly entranced, moved by the
grand and tranquil beauty of the pale-faced
night.</p>

<p>23. In his little garden, all suffused
with the tender radiance, his fruit-trees,
set in rows, outlined in shadows
upon the paths their slender limbs of
wood, scarce clothed with verdure.
The giant honeysuckle, clinging to the
house wall, exhaled its delicious,
honeyed breath&mdash;the soul of perfume
seemed to hover about in the warm,
clear night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span></p>

<p>24. He began to breathe deep,
drinking in the air as drunkards drink
their wine; and he walked slowly,
ravished, amazed, his niece almost
forgotten.</p>

<p>25. When he reached the open
country he paused to gaze upon the
broad sweep of landscape, all deluged
by that caressing radiance, all
drowned in that soft and sensuous
charm of peaceful night. Momently
the frogs sounded out their quick
metallic notes, and distant nightingales
added to the seductive moonlight
their welling music, which
charms to dreams without thought&mdash;that
gossamer, vibrant melody
born only to mate with kisses.</p>

<p>26. The Abbé moved again, his
courage unaccountably failing. He
felt as though he were enfeebled,
suddenly exhausted&mdash;he longed to
sit down, to linger there, to glorify
God for all His works.</p>

<p>27. A little farther on, following
the winding of the little river, curved
a row of tall poplars. Suspended
about and above the banks, enwrapping
the whole sinuous course of the
stream with a sort of light, transparent
down, was a fine white mist,
shot through by the moon-rays, and
transmuted by them into gleaming
silver.</p>

<p>28. The priest paused once again,
stirred to the deeps of his soul by a
growing, an irresistible feeling of
tenderness.</p>

<p>29. And a doubt, an undefined disquietude,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
crept over him; he discerned
the birth of one of those questions
which now and again came to
him.</p>

<p>30. Why had God made all this?
Since the night was ordained for
slumber, for unconsciousness, for repose,
for forgetfulness of everything,
why should He make it lovelier than
the day, sweeter than dawn and sunset?
And that star, slow-moving,
seductive, more poetic than the sun,
so like to destiny, and so delicate
that seemingly it was created to irradiate
things too subtle, too refined,
for the greater orb&mdash;why was
it come to illumine all the shades?</p>

<p>31. Why did not the most accomplished
of all singing birds repose
now like the others, but sing in the
unquiet dark?</p>

<p>32. Why was this semi-veil cast
over the world? Why this sighing
of the heart, this tumult of the soul,
this languor of the flesh?</p>

<p>33. Why this show of charms,
never seen by men because they are
asleep? For whose eyes was all this
sublime spectacle designed, all this
wealth of poetic loveliness diffused
from heaven over the earth?</p>

<p>34. And the Abbé did not understand
it at all.</p>

<p>35. But there below, at the very
edge of the field, under the arching
trees wet with luminous mist, two
shadows appeared, walking side by
side.</p>

<p>36. The man was the taller, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
had his arm about his sweetheart’s
neck; and from time to time he bent
to kiss her forehead. They animated
suddenly the lifeless landscape,
which enveloped their figures like a
divine frame fashioned expressly for
them. They seemed, those two, like
a single being, the being for whom
was created this tranquil, silent
night. Like a living answer, the answer
which his Master had sent to
his question, they moved toward the
priest.</p>

<p>37. Overwhelmed, his heart throbbing,
he stood still, and it seemed
as though there spread before him
some Biblical scene, like the loves
of Ruth and Boaz, the working out
of the Lord’s will in one of those
majestic dramas set forth in the
lives of the saints. The verses of
the Song of Songs, the ardent cries,
the call of the body&mdash;all the glowing
romance of that poem so aflame
with tenderness and love, began to
sing itself into his mind.</p>

<p>38. And he said to himself:
“Perhaps God made nights such as
this in order to cast the veil of the
ideal over the loves of men.”</p>

<p>39. He withdrew before this pair,
who went on arm in arm. True,
it was his niece; but now he asked
himself if he had not been upon the
verge of disobeying God. And, indeed,
if God did not permit love, why
did he visibly encompass it with glory
such as this?</p>

<p>40. And he fled, bewildered, almost
ashamed, as if he had penetrated
in a temple wherein he had
no right to enter.</p>

shall I, on the present occasion, select?” Having chosen a

<h3>IMPRESSIONISTIC STORIES</h3>
</div>


<p>The value of a literary term lies in the comprehensive
and precise picture which it calls up in the mind of him
who reads it. So we must seek to limit, as well as seize
upon, the meaning of this word “impressionistic.”</p>

<p>The first purpose in telling a story would seem to be the
pleasure or the profit of the hearer&mdash;if we exclude the
bore who tells a yarn chiefly to please himself. But a
closer scrutiny of certain stories discloses other objects
of the narrator, and these may be either subordinate or
paramount to considerations of benefit or entertainment.
The most important of these artistic purposes is to reproduce
in the hearer the full effect which a certain mood,
theme, character, situation, incident, or chain of incidents,
originally made upon the story-teller himself. When he
succeeds in reproducing in others his own feeling, by
such means as we shall presently study, he does so by
impressionistic means.</p>

<p>Poe, writing in <em>Graham’s Magazine</em>, May, 1842, says:
“A skilful literary artist has constructed a tale. If wise,
he has not fashioned his thoughts to accommodate his
incidents; but having conceived, with deliberate care, a
certain unique or single <em>effect</em> to be wrought out, he then
invents such incidents&mdash;he then combines such events&mdash;as
may best aid him in establishing the preconceived effect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
If his very initial sentence tend not to the outbringing
of this effect, then he has failed in his first step.
In the whole composition there should be no word written,
of which the tendency, direct or indirect, is not to
the one preëstablished design.”</p>

<p>It does not seem probable that Poe meant to speak of
impressionism as constituting so much a distinct type of
story as to point out its importance as a method in all
story-telling; and we must not overlook its usefulness in
this respect. Indeed, nearly all good short-stories begin,
in the mind of the author, and end, in the spirit of the
reader, with a more or less clear and unified impression.
Still, certain little fictions are, alike in theme and treatment,
so decidedly conceived and told with the purpose
of leaving the reader under the spell of a mood, a feeling,
a character, or a situation, that they are <span class="allsmcap">IMPRESSIONISTIC</span>
stories, rather than impressionistic <span class="allsmcap">STORIES</span>.</p>

<p>The natural tendency for the impressionistic writer is
to subordinate incident and plot to tone&mdash;in a word, to
emphasize a picture, whether internal or external, rather
than a set of happenings, which in dealing with fiction
we call the action. So an impressionistic narrative may
really tell a story of situation, crisis, and denouement, or,
as is more likely to be the case, it may tend decidedly
toward the sketch. All depends upon the nature of the
theme. Thus, the <em>beauty of sacrifice</em> demands an action
to illustrate that abnegation, and all the accessories must
serve as high-lights and shadows to bring out this motive
in strong relief; but the <em>tone of gloom</em> may be conveyed
without even the semblance of a plot.</p>


<p>Now a story may produce a gloomy effect without deliberately
picturing an atmosphere of gloom&mdash;it may
leave the reader with a vague, pessimistic distaste for joy,
and yet present no such picture. Or it may marvellously
delineate loneliness, without leaving that as the final impression
of the story. This is not impressionism, though
it may be very good story-telling. Impressionism is conscious
art, art prepense, and, as will be seen in the two
stories presented as examples in this section, subordinates
everything to tonal effect; in other words, the impressionistic
story symbolizes in human action some human mood
or condition. For this reason such stories are often
called stories of symbolism.</p>

<h3>HAWTHORNE AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in Salem, Massachusetts,
July 4, 1804. His New England ancestors bore the
name Hathorne, as did the author’s sea-captain father&mdash;also
a Nathaniel&mdash;who died at Surinam, Dutch Guiana,
when his son was four years old. In 1818 the family
moved to Raymond, Maine, but most of the youth’s education
was gotten at Salem, and there his family returned
in 1820. The following year he entered Bowdoin College,
from which he was graduated in 1825. At this time&mdash;when
he was twenty-one&mdash;he had already begun
<em>Twice-Told Tales</em>; it was then, too, that he inserted the
<em>w</em> into his name. He was now writing industriously,
often under a pseudonym; he also did considerable hack
and editorial work. During 1839 and a part of 1840 he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
served in the Boston Custom House; then he joined the
Brook Farm Community in 1841, but remained there only
a short time. He married Sophia Peabody in 1842. In
1846 he returned to the Customs service, in Salem, remaining
this time about three years. In 1853 he was
appointed by his classmate, President Pierce, as United
States Consul at Liverpool. During the more than three
years of his consulship he traveled widely in Great Britain,
and later spent much time in Italy, where some of
his best work was accomplished. During the last years
of his life he wrote but intermittently, being a prey to
depression and ill health. He died at Plymouth, New
Hampshire, May 19, 1864, and is buried in the Sleepy
Hollow Cemetery, Concord, Mass.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne was a remarkable novelist, essayist,
and short-story writer. <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> and <em>The
Marble Faun</em>, are his greatest novels. <em>The House of
the Seven Gables</em> is a series of related sketches rather
than a romance. Probably his best short-stories are
“The Birthmark,” “Rappaccini’s Daughter,” and
“Drowne’s Wooden Image,” in <em>Mosses From An Old
Manse</em>; “The Gray Champion,” “The Minister’s Black
Veil,” “The Gentle Boy,” “The Great Carbuncle,” “Dr.
Heidegger’s Experiment,” “The Ambitious Guest,”
“Wakefield,” and “The White Old Maid,” from <em>Twice-Told
Tales</em>; and “The Great Stone Face,” “Ethan
Brand” and “The Snow-Image,” in <em>The Snow-Image
and other Twice-Told Tales</em>. These three collections
contain also many charming sketches, while <em>The Wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
Book</em>, and <em>Tanglewood Tales</em> are rich in interest for
younger readers.</p>

<p>“The White Old Maid,” given herewith in full, was
first published in the <em>New England Magazine</em> for July,
1835, and was entitled “The Old Maid in the Winding
Sheet, by the Author of The Gray Champion.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hawthorne enjoyed the distinction of winning in his
day the almost unanimous approval of critics both at
home and abroad, and this in a period when criticism was
not a gentle art. Time, moreover, has only added to his
praises. As a fiction writer he had depth, breadth, and
height. Hawthorne alone among the fictionists of his era
may justly be said to have a philosophy of his own; his
themes cover a wide range; and the loftiness of his ideals
is well recognized. As Longfellow discerned, and generously
announced as early as 1837, Hawthorne was a
poet who wrote prose. He knew a mood in nature to
match every human emotion, and in her multiform life
he saw images to enforce a thousand striking comparisons.
He was a student of the soul, too, albeit a gloomy
one, for the most part. But while the sombreness of
lives beset by stern problems oppressed him, and but
little humor brightens his pages, one searches in vain for
a pessimistic spirit&mdash;Hawthorne’s knowledge of the human
heart saddened him, but it did not make him misanthropic.
One feels the reality, the vital bearing, of
the things he writes about. It is impossible to read him
appreciatively and not realize the sincerity of the man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
and the fine earnestness, the upright though severe justness,
with which he viewed life. Sweetness, beauty&mdash;haunting
beauty, indeed&mdash;and a certain airy lightness,
were not wanting in his work; but the big tones&mdash;resonant,
solemn at times, and inspiring always&mdash;were poetic
insight, fervid intensity, and lofty purpose. Hawthorne
was a seer. The inside of things was disclosed to him.
That which he could not see, he felt. And with a classic
purity of style he worded the fantastic, gloomy, lightsome,
or tragic pageantry of his creations in sentences
that live and live.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I wish God had given me the faculty of writing a sunshiny
book.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nathaniel Hawthorne</span>, <em>Letter to James T. Fields</em>.</p>


<p>Soon to be all spirit, I have already a spiritual sense of human
nature, and see deeply into the hearts of mankind, discovering
what is hidden from the wisest.... My glance comprehends
the crowd, and penetrates the breast of the solitary man.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nathaniel
Hawthorne</span>, <em>My Home Return</em>, in <em>Tales and Sketches</em>.</p>


<p>He uses his characters, like algebraic symbols, to work out
certain problems with; they are rather more, yet rather less,
than flesh and blood.&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. A. Beers</span>, quoted in Tappan’s <em>Topical
Notes on American Authors</em>.</p>

<p>Hawthorne’s style, at its best, is one of the most perfect media
employed by any writer using the English language. Dealing,
as it usually does, with an immaterial subject-matter, with dream-like
impressions, and fantastic products of the imagination, it is
concrete without being opaque,&mdash;luminously concrete, one might
say. No other writer that I know of has the power of making
his fancies visible and tangible without impairing their delicate
immateriality. If any writer can put the rainbow into words,
and yet leave it a rainbow, surely that writer is Hawthorne.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard
Le Gallienne</span>, <em>Attitudes and Avowals</em>.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span></p>


<p>In all his most daring fantasies Hawthorne is natural; and
though he may project his vision far beyond the boundaries of
fact, nowhere does he violate the laws of nature.... A brutal
misuse of the supernatural is perhaps the very lowest degradation
of the art of fiction. But “to mingle the marvellous rather
as a slight, delicate, and evanescent flavour than as any actual
portion of the substance,” to quote from the preface to the
<em>House of the Seven Gables</em>, this is, or should be, the aim of the
writer of Short-stories whenever his feet leave the firm ground
of fact as he strays in the unsubstantial realms of fantasy.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Brander
Matthews</span>, <em>The Philosophy of the Short-story</em>.</p>


<p>Hawthorne has been called a mystic, which he was not,&mdash;and
a psychological dreamer, which he was in very slight degree.
He was really the ghost of New England. I do not mean the
“spirit,” nor the “phantom,” but the ghost in the older sense
in which that term is used, the thin, rarefied essence which is
to be found somewhere behind the physical organization: embodied,
indeed, and not by any means in a shadowy or diminutive
earthly tabernacle, but yet only half embodied in it, endowed
with a certain painful sense of the gulf between his nature and
its organization, always recognizing the gulf, always trying to
bridge it over, and always more or less unsuccessful in the
attempt. His writings are not exactly spiritual writings, for
there is no dominating spirit in them. They are ghostly writings....
I may, perhaps, accept a phrase of which Hawthorne
himself was fond,&mdash;“the moonlight of romance,”&mdash;and compel it
to explain something of the secret of his characteristic genius.&mdash;<span class="smcap">R.
H. Hutton</span>, <em>Essays in Literary Criticism</em>.</p>

<p>This, too [“The White Old Maid”], is a story, in the sense
that something happens; and yet the real story, by which I mean
the narrative which would logically connect and develop these
events, is just hinted at, and is not very important. It is subordinated,
indeed, to a new aim. “The White Old Maid” is
narrative for a purpose, and this purpose is to suggest an impression,
and to leave us with a vivid sensation rather than a
number of remembered facts. In short, it is contrived, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
to leave a record of such and such an old woman who did this
or that, but rather to stamp upon our minds the impression of
a mystery-haunted house, mysterious figures entering, strange
words, and a terrible sorrow behind all. Towards such a result
the structure of the plot, every bit of description, every carefully
chosen word, directly tends.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Henry Seidel Canby</span>, <em>The Book
of the Short Story</em>.</p>

<h3>THE WHITE OLD MAID</h3>

<p class="big05 center">BY NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</p>

<div class="sidenote">Introduction of setting, giving
atmosphere of story.</div>


<p id="para1">The moonbeams came through
two deep and narrow windows, and
showed a spacious chamber richly
furnished in an antique fashion.
From one lattice the shadow of the
diamond panes was thrown upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
the floor; the ghostly light, through
the other, slept upon a bed, falling between
the heavy silken curtains, and
illuminating the face of a young man.<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Plot Situation.</span></span>
But, how quietly the slumberer lay!
how pale his features! and how like a
shroud the sheet was wound about
his frame! Yes; it was a corpse, in
its burial clothes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">This uncertainty strikes the
tone of the story, which
trembles constantly between
the real and the
fancied, the physical and
the spirit world, keeping
the reader in doubt as to
whether he is witnessing
a manifestation of the
supernatural or is deceived
by the mysterious atmosphere
of the unusual.</div>

<p>2. Suddenly, the fixed features
seemed to move with dark emotion.
Strange fantasy! It was but the
shadow of the fringed curtain waving
betwixt the dead face and the
moonlight, as the door of the chamber
opened and a girl stole softly
to the bedside. Was there delusion
in the moonbeams, or did her gesture
and her eye betray a gleam of
triumph, as she bent over the pale
corpse&mdash;pale as itself&mdash;and pressed
her living lips to the cold ones of
the dead? As she drew back from
that long kiss, her features writhed
as if a proud heart were fighting
with its anguish. Again it seemed
that the features of the corpse had
moved responsive to her own. Still
an illusion! The silken curtain had
waved, a second time, betwixt the
dead face and the moonlight, as another
fair young girl unclosed the
door, and glided, ghostlike, to the
bedside. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Two main characters introduced.</span></span>There the two maidens
stood, both beautiful, with the pale

“Thou hadst him living! The dead
is mine!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Motif</em> of story.</div>

<p>4. “Thine!” returned the other,
shuddering. “Well hast thou spoken!
The dead is thine!”</p>

<p>5. The proud girl started, and
stared into her face with a ghastly
look. But a wild and mournful expression
passed across the features
of the gentle one; and weak and
helpless, she sank down on the bed,
her head pillowed beside that of the
corpse, and her hair mingling with
his dark locks. A creature of hope
and joy, the first draught of sorrow
had bewildered her.</p>

<p>6. “Edith!” cried her rival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note “of the heart.”</div>

<p>7. Edith groaned, as with a sudden
compassion of the heart; and removing
her cheek from the dead youth’s
pillow, she stood upright, fearfully
encountering the eyes of the lofty
girl.</p>

<p>8. “Wilt thou betray me?” said
the latter calmly.</p>

<p>9. “Till the dead bid me speak, I
will be silent,” answered Edith.
“Leave us alone together! Go, and
live many years, and then return, and
tell me of thy life. He, too, will
be here! Then, if thou tellest of
sufferings more than death, we will
both forgive thee.”</p>

<p>10. “And what shall be the
token?” asked the proud girl, as if
her heart acknowledged a meaning in
these wild words.</p>

<p>11. “This lock of hair,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
Edith, lifting one of the dark, clustering
curls that lay heavily on the
dead man’s brow.</p>


<p id="para12">12. The two maidens joined their
hands over the bosom of the corpse,
and appointed a day and hour, far,
far in time to come, for their next
meeting in that chamber. The
statelier girl gave one deep look at
the motionless countenance, and departed&mdash;yet
turned again and
trembled ere she closed the door, almost
believing that her dead lover
frowned upon her. And Edith, too!
Was not her white form fading into
the moonlight? Scorning her own
weakness she went forth, and perceived
that a negro slave was waiting
in the passage with a wax-light,
which he held between her face and
his own, and regarded her, as she
thought, with an ugly expression of
merriment. Lifting his torch on
high, the slave lighted her down the
staircase, and undid the portal of
the mansion. <span class="sidenote">End of first part of story.</span>The young clergyman

the world seemed new again, so
much older was it grown since the
night when those pale girls had
clasped their hands across the
bosom of the corpse. In the interval,
a lonely woman had passed from
youth to extreme age, and was
known by all the town as the “Old
Maid in the Winding Sheet.”<span class="sidenote">Hawthorne’s first title for
this story.</span> A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
taint of insanity had affected her
whole life, but so quiet, sad, and
gentle, so utterly free from violence,
that she was suffered to pursue her
harmless fantasies, unmolested by
the world, with whose business or
pleasure she had nought to do. <span class="sidenote">Character delineation, largely
mental and moral.</span>She
dwelt alone, and never came into the
daylight, except to follow funerals.
Whenever a corpse was borne along
the street in sunshine, rain, or
snow; whether a pompous train of
the rich and proud thronged after it,
or few and humble were the mourners,
behind them came the lonely
woman in a long white garment
which the people called her shroud.
She took no place among the kindred
or the friends, but stood at the
door to hear the funeral prayer, and
walked in the rear of the procession,
as one whose earthly charge it was
to haunt the house of mourning, and
be the shadow of affliction, and see
that the dead were duly buried. <span class="sidenote">Key.</span>So
long had this been her custom that
the inhabitants of the town deemed
her a part of every funeral, as much
as the coffin pall, or the very corpse
itself, and augured ill of the sinner’s
destiny unless the “Old Maid in the
Winding Sheet” came gliding, like
a ghost, behind. <span class="sidenote">Contributory incident.</span>Once, it is said, she
affrighted a bridal party with her
pale presence, appearing suddenly in
the illuminated hall, just as the priest
was uniting a false maid to a wealthy
man, before her lover had been dead
a year. Evil was the omen to that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
marriage! Sometimes she stole
forth by moonlight and visited the
graves of venerable Integrity, and
wedded Love, and virgin Innocence,<span class="sidenote">Note language of symbolism.</span>
and every spot where the ashes of a
kind and faithful heart were mouldering.
Over the hillocks of those
favored dead would she stretch out
her arms, with a gesture, as if she
were scattering seeds; and many believed
that she brought them from
the garden of Paradise; for the
graves which she had visited were
green beneath the snow, and covered
with sweet flowers from April to
November. Her blessing was better
than a holy verse upon the tombstone.<span class="sidenote">Key.</span>
Thus wore away her long,
sad, peaceful, and fantastic life, till
few were so old as she, and the people
of later generations wondered
how the dead had ever been buried,
or mourners had endured their
grief, without the “Old Maid in the
Winding Sheet.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Third stage.</div>


<p id="para14">14. Still years went on, and still
she followed funerals, and was not
yet summoned to her own festival
of death. One afternoon the great
street of the town was all alive with
business and bustle, though the sun
now gilded only the upper half of the
church spire, having left the housetops
and loftiest trees in shadow. <span class="sidenote">Preparation for main crisis.<br />
                               Opening of <span class="smcap"> Main Plot Incident</span>.</span>
The scene was cheerful and animated,
in spite of the sombre shade
between the high brick buildings.
Here were pompous merchants, in
white wigs and laced velvet; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
bronzed faces of sea-captains; the
foreign garb and air of Spanish creoles;<span class="sidenote">Local-color.</span>
and the disdainful port of natives
of Old England; all contrasted
with the rough aspect of one or two
back settlers, negotiating sales of
timber from forests where axe had
never sounded. Sometimes a lady
passed, swelling roundly forth in an
embroidered petticoat, balancing her
steps in high-heeled shoes, and
courtesying with lofty grace to the
punctilious obeisances of the gentlemen.<span class="sidenote">Central setting; return to
original setting.</span>
The life of the town seemed
to have its very centre not far from
an old mansion, that stood somewhat
back from the pavement, surrounded
by neglected grass, with a strange air
of loneliness, rather deepened than
dispelled by the throng so near. Its
site would have been suitably occupied
by a magnificent Exchange or
a brick block, lettered all over with
various signs; or the large house
itself might have made a noble tavern,
with the “King’s Arms” swinging
before it, and guests in every
chamber, instead of the present solitude.<span class="sidenote">Development of setting, and
<span class="allsmcap">TONE OF AN EMPTY HOUSE</span>.</span>
But owing to some dispute
about the right of inheritance, the
mansion had been long without a
tenant, decaying from year to year,
and throwing the stately gloom of its
shadow over the busiest part of the
town. Such was the scene, and
such the time, when a figure unlike
any that have been described was
observed at a distance down the
street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">First main character.</div>

<p>15. “I espy a strange sail, yonder,”
remarked a Liverpool captain;
“that woman in the long white garment!”</p>

<p>16. The sailor seemed much struck
by the object, as were several others
who, at the same moment, caught
a glimpse of the figure that had attracted
his notice. Almost immediately
the various topics of conversation
gave place to speculations, in
an undertone, on this unwonted occurrence.</p>

<p>17. “Can there be a funeral so late
this afternoon?” inquired some.</p>

<p>18. They looked for the signs of
death at every door&mdash;the sexton,
the hearse, the assemblage of black-clad
relatives&mdash;all that makes up the
woful pomp of funerals. They
raised their eyes, also, to the
sun-gilt spire of the church, and
wondered that no clang proceeded
from its bell, which had always
tolled till now when this figure appeared
in the light of day. But none
had heard that a corpse was to be
borne to its home that afternoon,
nor was there any token of funeral,
except the apparition of the “Old
Maid in the Winding Sheet.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Key.</div>

<p>19. “What may this portend?”
asked each man of his neighbor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contrast.</div>

<p>20. All smiled as they put the
question, yet with a certain trouble
in their eyes, as if pestilence or some
other wide calamity were prognosticated
by the untimely intrusion
among the living of one whose presence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
had always been associated with
death and woe. What a comet is to
the earth was that sad woman to the
town. Still she moved on, while the
hum of surprise was hushed at her
approach, and the proud and the  <span class="sidenote">Impressionism vivid.</span>
humble stood aside, that her white
garment might not wave against
them. It was a long, loose robe, of
spotless purity. Its wearer appeared
very old, pale, emaciated, and feeble, <span class="sidenote">Direct character description.</span>
yet glided onward without the unsteady
pace of extreme age. At one
point of her course a little rosy boy
burst forth from a door, and ran,
with open arms, towards the ghostly
woman, seeming to expect a kiss from
her bloodless lips. She made a slight <span class="sidenote">Contrast.</span>
pause, fixing her eye upon him with
an expression of no earthly sweetness,
so the child shivered and stood
awe-struck, rather than affrighted,
while the Old Maid passed on. <span class="sidenote">Character delineation by
suggestion.</span>Perhaps
her garment might have been
polluted even by an infant’s touch;
perhaps her kiss would have been
death to the sweet boy within a year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tone of story summarized.</div>

<p>21. “She is but a shadow,” whispered
the superstitious. “The child
put forth his arms and could not
grasp her robe!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crisis approaches.</div>


<p>22. The wonder was increased when
the Old Maid passed beneath the
porch of the deserted mansion, ascended
the moss-covered steps, lifted
the iron knocker, and gave three raps.
The people could only conjecture that
some old remembrance, troubling her
bewildered brain, had impelled the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
poor woman hither to visit the
friends of her youth; <span class="sidenote">The house mentioned in
paragraphs <a href="#para1">1</a>, <a href="#para12">12</a> and <a href="#para14">14</a>.</span>all gone from
their home long since and forever,
unless their ghosts still haunted it&mdash;fit
company for the “Old Maid in the
Winding Sheet.” An elderly man approached
the steps, and, reverently
uncovering his gray locks, essayed to
explain the matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note “None&mdash;have.”<br />
Contributory incident.</div>

<p>23. “None, Madam,” said he,
“have dwelt in this house these fifteen
years agone&mdash;no, not since the
death of old Colonel Fenwicke,<span class="sidenote">First mention of name.</span> whose
funeral you may remember to have
followed. His heirs, being ill agreed
among themselves, have let the mansion-house
go to ruin.”</p>

<p>24. The Old Maid looked slowly
round with a slight gesture of one
hand, and a finger of the other upon
her lip, appearing more shadow-like
than ever in the obscurity of the
porch. But again she lifted the hammer,
and gave, this time, a single
rap. <span class="sidenote">Note atmosphere of vagueness.</span>Could it be that a footstep was
now heard coming down the staircase
of the old mansion, which all
conceived to have been so long untenanted?
Slowly, feebly, yet heavily,
like the pace of an aged and
infirm person, the step approached,
more distinct on every downward
stair, till it reached the portal. The
bar fell on the inside; the door opened.
One upward glance towards the
church spire, whence the sunshine
had just faded, was the last that the
people saw of the “Old Maid in the
Winding Sheet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Tone of mystery.</div>

<p>25. “Who undid the door?” asked
many.</p>

<p>26. This question, owing to the
depth of shadow beneath the porch,
no one could satisfactorily answer.
Two or three aged men, while protesting
against an inference which
might be drawn,<span class="sidenote">See <a href="#para12">¶12</a>.</span> affirmed that the
person within was a negro, and bore
a singular resemblance to old Cæsar,
formerly a slave in the house, but
freed by death some thirty years before.</p>

<p>27. “Her summons has waked up
a servant of the old family,” said
one, half seriously.</p>

<p>28. “Let us wait here,” replied
another. “More guests will knock
at the door, anon. But the gate of
the graveyard should be thrown
open!”</p>


<p>29. Twilight had overspread the
town before the crowd began to
separate, or the comments on this
incident were exhausted. <span class="sidenote">Preparation for climax.</span>One after
another was wending his way homeward,
when a coach&mdash;no common
spectacle in those days&mdash;drove slowly
into the street. It was an old-fashioned
equipage, hanging close to
the ground, with arms on the panels,
a footman behind, and a grave, corpulent <span class="sidenote">No indication whence it
                                          came.</span>
coachman seated high in front&mdash;the
whole giving an idea of solemn
state and dignity. There was something
awful in the heavy rumbling of
the wheels. The coach rolled down
the street, till, coming to the gateway <span class="sidenote">Setting.</span>
of the deserted mansion, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
drew up, and the footman sprang to
the ground.</p>

<p>30. “Whose grand coach is this?”
asked a very inquisitive body.</p>

<p>31. The footman made no reply,
but ascended the steps of the old
house, gave three raps with the iron
hammer, and returned to open the
coach door. <span class="sidenote">Three raps signify a formal
demand for entrance.</span>An old man, possessed
of the heraldic lore so common in
that day, examined the shield of arms
on the panel.</p>

<p>32. “Azure, a lion’s head erased,
between three flower-de-luces,” said
he; then whispered the name of the
family to whom these bearings belonged.<span class="sidenote">Setting.</span>
The last inheritor of his
honors was recently dead, after a
long residence amid the splendor of
the British court, where his birth
and wealth had given him no mean
station. “He left no child,” continued
the herald, “and these arms,
being in a lozenge, betoken that the
coach appertains to his widow.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Second Main Character.</span></div>

<p>33. Further disclosures, perhaps,
might have been made had not the
speaker suddenly been struck dumb
by the stern eye of an ancient lady
who thrust forth her head from the
coach, preparing to descend. As she
emerged, the people saw that her
dress was magnificent, and her figure
dignified, in spite of age and infirmity&mdash;a
stately ruin but with a look,
at once, of pride and wretchedness.
Her strong and rigid features had an
awe about them, unlike that of the
white Old Maid, but as of something
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
evil. <span class="sidenote">Contributory incident.</span>She passed up the steps,
leaning on a gold-headed cane; the
door swung open as she ascended&mdash;and
the light of a torch glittered
on the embroidery of her dress, and
gleamed on the pillars of the porch.
After a momentary pause&mdash;a glance
backwards&mdash;and then a desperate
effort&mdash;she went in. The decipherer
of the coat of arms had ventured up
the lowest step, and shrinking back
immediately, pale and tremulous, affirmed
that the torch was held by
the very image of old Cæsar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Subordinate character of
central action.<br />
Compare <a href="#para12">¶12</a>.</div>

<p>34. “But such a hideous grin,” added
he, “was never seen on the face
of mortal man, black or white! It
will haunt me till my dying day.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the use of shadows
and twilights as accessories.</div>

<p>35. Meanwhile, the coach had
wheeled round, with a prodigious clatter
on the pavement, and rumbled up
the street, disappearing in the twilight,
while the ear still tracked its
course. Scarcely was it gone, when
the people began to question whether
the coach and attendants, the ancient
lady, the spectre of old Cæsar,
and the Old Maid herself, <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Key.</span></span>were not
all a strangely combined delusion,
with some dark purport in its mystery.<span class="sidenote">Atmosphere&mdash;a sense of
something about to occur.</span>
The whole town was astir, so
that, instead of dispersing, the crowd
continually increased, and stood gazing
up at the windows of the mansion,
now silvered by the brightening
moon. The elders, glad to indulge
the narrative propensity of age, told
of the long-faded splendor of the
family, the entertainments they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
given, and the guests, the greatest of
the land, and even titled and noble
ones from abroad, who had passed
beneath that portal. These graphic
reminiscences seemed to call up the
ghosts of those to whom they referred.
So strong was the impression
on some of the more imaginative
hearers, that two or three were seized
with trembling fits, at one and the
same moment, protesting that they
had distinctly heard three other raps
of the iron knocker.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contributory material.</div>

<p>36. “Impossible!” exclaimed others.
“See! The moon shines beneath
the porch, and shows every part
of it, except in the narrow shade of
that pillar. There is no one there!”</p>

<p>37. “Did not the door open?”
whispered one of these fanciful persons.</p>

<p>38. “Didst thou see it, too?” said
his companion, in a startled tone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vagueness.</div>

<p>39. But the general sentiment was
opposed to the idea that a third
visitant had made application at the
door of the deserted house. A few,
however, adhered to this new marvel,
and even declared that a red gleam
like that of a torch had shone through
the great front window, as if the
negro were lighting a guest up the
staircase. <span class="sidenote">Tone.</span>This, too, was pronounced
a mere fantasy. But at once the
whole multitude started, and each
man beheld his own terror painted
in the faces of all the rest.</p>

<p>40. “What an awful thing is this!”
cried they.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Minor climax&mdash;preparation
for main climax.</div>


<p>41. A shriek too fearfully distinct
for doubt had been heard within the
mansion, breaking forth suddenly,
and succeeded by a deep stillness, as
if a heart had burst in giving it utterance.
The people knew not whether
to fly from the very sight of the
house, or to rush trembling in, and
search out the strange mystery.
Amid their confusion and affright,<span class="sidenote">Note shifting of tenses.</span>
they are somewhat reassured by the
appearance of their clergyman, a
venerable patriarch, and equally a
saint, who had taught them and their
fathers the way to heaven for more
than the space of an ordinary life-time.<span class="sidenote">Contributory incident.</span>
He was a reverend figure, with
long, white hair upon his shoulders,
a white beard upon his breast, and a
back so bent over his staff that he
seemed to be looking downward continually,
as if to choose a proper
grave for his weary frame. It was
some time before the good old man,
being deaf and of impaired intellect,
could be made to comprehend such
portions of the affair as were comprehensible
at all. But, when possessed
of the facts, his energies
assumed unexpected vigor.</p>

<p>42. “Verily,” said the old gentleman,
“it will be fitting that I enter
the mansion-house of the worthy
Colonel Fenwicke, lest any harm
should have befallen that true Christian
woman whom ye call the ‘Old
Maid in the Winding Sheet.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Again a shift in the manner
of narration.</div>

<p>43. Behold, then, the venerable
clergyman ascending the steps of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
mansion, with a torch-bearer behind
him. It was the elderly man who
had spoken to the Old Maid, and the
same who had afterwards explained
the shield of arms and recognized the
features of the negro. Like their
predecessors, they gave three raps
with the iron hammer.</p>

<p>44. “Old Cæsar cometh not,” observed
the priest. “Well I wot he
no longer doth service in this mansion.”</p>

<p>45. “Assuredly, then, it was something
worse, in old Cæsar’s likeness!”
said the other adventurer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">One who ventures.</div>

<p>46. “Be it as God wills,” answered
the clergyman. “See! my
strength, though it be much decayed,
hath sufficed to open this heavy door.
Let us enter and pass up the staircase.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Key to tone further developed.</div>

<p>47. Here occurred a singular exemplification
of the dreamy state of
a very old man’s mind. As they
ascended the wide flight of stairs,
the aged clergyman appeared to move
with caution, occasionally standing
aside, and oftener bending his head,
as it were in salutation, thus practising
all the gestures of one who
makes his way through a throng.
Reaching the head of the staircase,
he looked around with sad and
solemn benignity, laid aside his staff,
bared his hoary locks, and was evidently
on the point of commencing a
prayer.</p>

<p>48. “Reverend Sir,” said his attendant,
who conceived this a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
suitable prelude to their further
search, “would it not be well that
the people join with us in prayer?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Confusion between real and
unreal further illustrated
by contributory material.</div>

<p>49. “Welladay!” cried the old
clergyman, staring strangely around
him. “Art thou here with me, and
none other? Verily, past times were
present to me, and I deemed that I
was to make a funeral prayer, as
many a time heretofore, from the
head of this staircase. Of a truth,
I saw the shades of many that are
gone. <span class="sidenote">Deft introduction of central
character.</span>Yea, I have prayed at their
burials, one after another, and the
‘Old Maid in the Winding Sheet’
hath seen them to their graves!”</p>

<p>50. Being now more thoroughly
awake to their present purpose, he
took his staff and struck forcibly on
the floor, till there came an echo
from each deserted chamber, but no
menial to answer their summons.<span class="sidenote">Tone.</span>
They therefore walked along the
passage, and again paused, opposite
to the great front window through
which was seen the crowd, in the
shadow and partial moonlight of the
street beneath.<span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Key.</span></span> On their right hand
was the open door of a chamber, and
a closed one on their left. The clergyman
pointed his cane to the carved
oak panel of the latter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foundation situation.</div>

<p>51. “Within that chamber,” observed
he, “a whole life-time since,
did I sit by the death-bed of a goodly
young man, who, being now at
the last gasp”&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Atmosphere.</div>

<p>52. Apparently there was some
powerful excitement in the ideas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
which had now flashed across his
mind. He snatched the torch from
his companion’s hand, and threw
open the door with such sudden
violence that the flame was extinguished,
leaving them no other light
than the moonbeams, which fell
through two windows into the spacious
chamber. <span class="sidenote">Note author’s device.</span>It was sufficient to
discover all that could be known.
In a high-backed oaken armchair,
upright, with her hands clasped
across her heart, and her head
thrown back, sat the “Old Maid in
the Winding Sheet.” The stately
dame had fallen on her knees, with
her forehead on the holy knees of the
Old Maid, one hand upon the floor
and the other pressed convulsively
against her heart. <span class="sidenote">The decision must be inferred.</span>It clutched a lock
of hair, once sable, now discolored
with a greenish mould. As the
priest and layman advanced into the
chamber, the Old Maid’s features
assumed such a semblance of shifting
expression that they trusted to
hear the whole mystery explained by
a single word. <span class="sidenote">Tone of vagueness to the
end.</span>But it was only the
shadow of a tattered curtain waving
betwixt the dead face and the moonlight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Climax.</span><br />
Vague denouement.</div>

<p>53. “Both dead!” said the venerable
man. “Then who shall divulge
the secret? Methinks it glimmers to
and fro in my mind, like the light
and shadow across the Old Maid’s
face. And now ’tis gone!”</p>

<p>During the whole of a dull,
dark, and soundless day in the
autumn of the year, when the clouds
hung oppressively low in the heavens,
I had been passing alone, on horseback,
through a singularly dreary
tract of country; and at length found
myself, as the shades of the evening
drew on, within view of the melancholy
House of Usher. I know not
how it was, but, with the first glimpse
of the building, a sense of insufferable
gloom pervaded my spirit. I
say insufferable; for the feeling was
unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable,
because poetic, sentiment
with which the mind usually receives
even the sternest natural images of
the desolate or terrible. I looked upon
the scene before me&mdash;upon the
mere house, and the simple landscape
features of the domain, upon
the bleak walls, upon the vacant eye-like
windows, upon a few rank sedges,
and upon a few white trunks of
decayed trees&mdash;with an utter depression
of soul which I can compare
to no earthly sensation more properly
than to the after-dream of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
reveler upon opium: the bitter lapse
into everyday life, the hideous dropping
off of the veil. There was an
iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the
heart, an unredeemed dreariness of
thought, which no goading of the
imagination could torture into aught
of the sublime. What was it&mdash;I
paused to think&mdash;what was it that
so unnerved me in the contemplation
of the House of Usher? It was a
mystery all insoluble; nor could I
grapple with the shadow fancies that
crowded upon me as I pondered. I
was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory
conclusion that while, beyond
doubt, there <em>are</em> combinations
of very simple natural objects which
have the power of thus affecting us,
still the analysis of this power lies
among considerations beyond our
depth. It was possible, I reflected,
that a mere different arrangement of
the particulars of the scene, of the
details of the picture, would be sufficient
to modify, or perhaps to annihilate,
its capacity for sorrowful
impression, and, acting upon this idea,
I reined my horse to the precipitous
brink of a black and lurid tarn that
lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling,
and gazed down&mdash;but with a
shudder even more thrilling than before&mdash;upon
the remodeled and inverted
images of the gray sedge, and
the ghastly tree-stems, and the vacant
and eye-like windows.</p>

<p>2. Nevertheless, in this mansion of
gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
of some weeks. Its proprietor,
Roderick Usher, had been one of my
boon companions in boyhood; but
many years had elapsed since our last
meeting. A letter, however, had
lately reached me in a distant part
of the country&mdash;a letter from him&mdash;which
in its wildly importunate
nature had admitted of no other than
a personal reply. The MS. gave
evidence of nervous agitation. The
writer spoke of acute bodily illness,
of a mental disorder which oppressed
him, and of an earnest desire to see
me, as his best and indeed his only
personal friend, with a view of attempting,
by the cheerfulness of my
society, some alleviation of his malady.
It was the manner in which all
this, and much more, was said&mdash;it
was the apparent <em>heart</em> that went
with his request&mdash;which allowed me
no room for hesitation; and I accordingly
obeyed forthwith what I still
considered a very singular summons.</p>

<p>3. Although as boys we had been
even intimate associates, yet I really
knew little of my friend. His reserve
had been always excessive and
habitual. I was aware, however, that
his very ancient family had been noted,
time out of mind, for a peculiar
sensibility of temperament, displaying
itself, through long ages, in many
works of exalted art, and manifested
of late in repeated deeds of
munificent yet unobtrusive charity,
as well as in a passionate devotion to
the intricacies, perhaps even more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
than to the orthodox and easily
recognizable beauties, of musical
science. I had learned, too, the very
remarkable fact that the stem of the
Usher race, all time-honored as it
was, had put forth at no period any
enduring branch; in other words,
that the entire family lay in the direct
line of descent, and had always, with
a very trifling and very temporary
variation, so lain. It was this deficiency,
I considered, while running
over in thought the perfect keeping
of the character of the premises with
the accredited character of the people,
and while speculating upon the possible
influence which the one, in the
long lapse of centuries, might have
exercised upon the other,&mdash;it was
this deficiency, perhaps, of collateral
issue, and the consequent undeviating
transmission from sire to son of
the patrimony with the name, which
had at length so identified the two
as to merge the original title of the
estate in the quaint and equivocal
appellation of the “House of Usher,”&mdash;an
appellation which seemed to
include, in the minds of the peasantry
who used it, both the family
and the family mansion.</p>

<p>4. I have said that the sole effect
of my somewhat childish experiment,
that of looking down within the tarn,
had been to deepen the first singular
impression. There can be no doubt
that the consciousness of the rapid
increase of my superstition&mdash;for why
should I not so term it?&mdash;served<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
mainly to accelerate the increase itself.
Such, I have long known, is
the paradoxical law of all sentiments
having terror as a basis. And it
might have been for this reason
only, that, when I again uplifted my
eyes to the house itself from its
image in the pool, there grew in my
mind a strange fancy,&mdash;a fancy so
ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention
it to show the vivid force of the
sensations which oppressed me. I
had so worked upon my imagination
as really to believe that about the
whole mansion and domain there
hung an atmosphere peculiar to
themselves and their immediate
vicinity: an atmosphere which had no
affinity with the air of heaven, but
which had reeked up from the decayed
trees, and the gray wall, and
the silent tarn; a pestilent and mystic
vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible,
and leaden-hued.</p>

<p>5. Shaking off from my spirit what
<em>must</em> have been a dream, I scanned
more narrowly the real aspect of the
building. Its principal feature seemed
to be that of an excessive antiquity.
The discoloration of ages had
been great. Minute fungi overspread
the whole exterior, hanging in a fine
tangled web-work from the eaves.
Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary
dilapidation. No portion
of the masonry had fallen; and there
appeared to be a wild inconsistency
between its still perfect adaptation
of parts and the crumbling condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
of the individual stones. In this
there was much that reminded me of
the specious totality of old wood-work
which has rotted for long years
in some neglected vault, with no disturbance
from the breath of the external
air. Beyond this indication of
extensive decay, however, the fabric
gave little token of instability. Perhaps
the eye of a scrutinizing observer
might have discovered a
barely perceptible fissure, which, extending
from the roof of the building
in front, made its way down the wall
in a zigzag direction, until it became
lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.</p>

<p>6. Noticing these things, I rode
over a short causeway to the house.
A servant in waiting took my horse,
and I entered the Gothic archway of
the hall. A valet, of stealthy step,
thence conducted me in silence
through many dark and intricate
passages in my progress to the
studio of his master. Much that I
encountered on the way contributed,
I know not how, to heighten the
vague sentiments of which I have
already spoken. While the objects
around me&mdash;while the carvings of
the ceiling, the sombre tapestries of
the walls, the ebon blackness of the
floors, and the phantasmagoric armorial
trophies which rattled as I
strode, were but matters of which,
or to such as which, I had been accustomed
from my infancy,&mdash;while
I hesitated not to acknowledge how
familiar was all this, I still wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
to find how unfamiliar were the
fancies which ordinary images were
stirring up. On one of the staircases
I met the physician of the
family. His countenance, I thought,
wore a mingled expression of low
cunning and perplexity. He accosted
me with trepidation and passed
on. The valet now threw open a
door and ushered me into the presence
of his master.</p>

<p>7. The room in which I found myself
was very large and lofty. The
windows were long, narrow, and
pointed, and at so vast a distance
from the black oaken floor as to be
altogether inaccessible from within.
Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light
made their way through the trellised
panes, and served to render sufficiently
distinct the more prominent
objects around; the eye, however,
struggled in vain to reach the remoter
angles of the chamber, or the
recesses of the vaulted and fretted
ceiling. Dark draperies hung upon
the walls. The general furniture was
profuse, comfortless, antique, and
tattered. Many books and musical
instruments lay scattered about, but
failed to give any vitality to the
scene. I felt that I breathed an
atmosphere of sorrow. An air of
stern, deep, and irredeemable gloom
hung over and pervaded all.</p>

<p>8. Upon my entrance, Usher arose
from a sofa on which he had been lying
at full length, and greeted me
with a vivacious warmth which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
much in it, I at first thought, of an
overdone cordiality,&mdash;of the constrained
effort of the <em>ennuyé</em> man of
the world. A glance, however, at his
countenance, convinced me of his
perfect sincerity. We sat down; and
for some moments, while he spoke
not, I gazed upon him with a feeling
half of pity, half of awe. Surely
man had never before so terribly
altered, in so brief a period, as had
Roderick Usher! It was with difficulty
that I could bring myself to
admit the identity of the wan being
before me with the companion of my
early boyhood. Yet the character
of his face had been at all times remarkable.
A cadaverousness of complexion;
an eye large, liquid, and
luminous beyond comparison; lips
somewhat thin and very pallid, but of
a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose
of a delicate Hebrew model, but with
a breadth of nostril unusual in similar
formations; a finely-moulded
chin, speaking, in its want of prominence,
of a want of moral energy;
hair of a more than web-like softness
and tenuity,&mdash;these features,
with an inordinate expansion above
the regions of the temple, made up
altogether a countenance not easily
to be forgotten. And now in the
mere exaggeration of the prevailing
character of these features, and of
the expression they were wont to
convey, lay so much of change that
I doubted to whom I spoke. The
now ghastly pallor of the skin, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
the now miraculous lustre of the eye,
above all things startled and even
awed me. The silken hair, too, had
been suffered to grow all unheeded,
and as, in its wild gossamer texture,
it floated rather than fell about the
face, I could not, even with effort,
connect its arabesque expression
with any idea of simple humanity.</p>

<p>9. In the manner of my friend I
was at once struck with an incoherence,
an inconsistency; and I soon
found this to arise from a series of
feeble and futile struggles to overcome
an habitual trepidancy, an excessive
nervous agitation. For something
of this nature I had indeed
been prepared, no less by his letter
than by reminiscences of certain
boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced
from his peculiar physical
conformation and temperament. His
action was alternately vivacious and
sullen. His voice varied rapidly
from a tremulous indecision (when
the animal spirits seemed utterly in
abeyance) to that species of energetic
concision&mdash;that abrupt, weighty,
unhurried, and hollow-sounding
enunciation, that leaden, self-balanced,
and perfectly modulated guttural
utterance&mdash;which may be
observed in the lost drunkard, or
the irreclaimable eater of opium,
during the periods of his most intense
excitement.</p>

<p>10. It was thus that he spoke of
the object of my visit, of his earnest
desire to see me, and of the solace<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
he expected me to afford him. He
entered at some length into what he
conceived to be the nature of his
malady. It was, he said, a constitutional
and a family evil, and one for
which he despaired to find a remedy,&mdash;a
mere nervous affection, he immediately
added, which would undoubtedly
soon pass off. It displayed
itself in a host of unnatural
sensations. Some of these, as he detailed
them, interested and bewildered
me; although, perhaps, the terms
and the general manner of the narration
had their weight. He suffered
much from a morbid acuteness of the
senses; the most insipid food was
alone endurable; he could wear only
garments of certain texture; the
odors of all flowers were oppressive;
his eyes were tortured by even a faint
light; and there were but peculiar
sounds, and these from stringed instruments,
which did not inspire him
with horror.</p>

<p>11. To an anomalous species of terror
I found him a bounden slave.
“I shall perish,” said he, “I <em>must</em>
perish in this deplorable folly. Thus,
thus, and not otherwise, shall I be
lost. I dread the events of the future,
not in themselves, but in their
results. I shudder at the thought of
any, even the most trivial, incident,
which may operate upon this intolerable
agitation of soul. I have, indeed,
no abhorrence of danger, except
in its absolute effect,&mdash;in terror.
In this unnerved, in this pitiable condition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
I feel that the period will
sooner or later arrive when I must
abandon life and reason together in
some struggle with the grim phantasm,
<span class="smcap">Fear</span>.”</p>

<p>12. I learned moreover at intervals,
and through broken and equivocal
hints, another singular feature of his
mental condition. He was enchained
by certain superstitious impressions
in regard to the dwelling which
he tenanted, and whence for many
years he had never ventured forth, in
regard to an influence whose supposititious
force was conveyed in
terms too shadowy here to be restated,&mdash;an
influence which some peculiarities
in the mere form and
substance of his family mansion had,
by dint of long sufferance, he said,
obtained over his spirit; an effect
which the physique of the gray walls
and turrets, and of the dim tarn into
which they all looked down, had
at length brought about upon the
morale of his existence.</p>

<p>13. He admitted, however, although
with hesitation, that much of the
peculiar gloom which thus afflicted
him could be traced to a more natural
and far more palpable origin,&mdash;to
the severe and long-continued illness,
indeed to the evidently approaching
dissolution, of a tenderly
beloved sister, his sole companion
for long years, his last and only relative
on earth. “Her decease,” he
said, with a bitterness which I can
never forget, “would leave him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
(him, the hopeless and the frail) the
last of the ancient race of the Ushers.”
While he spoke, the lady
Madeline (for so was she called)
passed slowly through a remote portion
of the apartment, and, without
having noticed my presence, disappeared.
I regarded her with an utter
astonishment not unmingled with
dread, and yet I found it impossible
to account for such feelings. A
sensation of stupor oppressed me, as
my eyes followed her retreating
steps. When a door, at length, closed
upon her, my glance sought instinctively
and eagerly the countenance
of the brother; but he had buried
his face in his hands, and I could
only perceive that a far more than
ordinary wanness had overspread the
emaciated fingers through which
trickled many passionate tears.</p>

<p>14. The disease of the lady Madeline
had long baffled the skill of her
physicians. A settled apathy, a gradual
wasting away of the person, and
frequent although transient affections
of a partially cataleptical character,
were the unusual diagnosis. Hitherto
she had steadily borne up against
the pressure of her malady, and had
not betaken herself finally to bed:
but, on the closing-in of the evening
of my arrival at the house, she succumbed
(as her brother told me at
night with inexpressible agitation)
to the prostrating power of the destroyer;
and I learned that the
glimpse I had obtained of her person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
would thus probably be the last
I should obtain,&mdash;that the lady, at
least while living, would be seen by
me no more.</p>

<p>15. For several days ensuing, her
name was unmentioned by either
Usher or myself; and during this
period I was busied in earnest endeavors
to alleviate the melancholy of
my friend. We painted and read together;
or I listened, as if in a dream,
to the wild improvisation of his
speaking guitar. And thus, as a
closer and still closer intimacy admitted
me more unreservedly into
the recesses of his spirit, the more
bitterly did I perceive the futility of
all attempt at cheering a mind from
which darkness, as if an inherent
positive quality, poured forth upon
all objects of the moral and physical
universe, in one unceasing radiation
of gloom.</p>

<p>16. I shall ever bear about me a
memory of the many solemn hours
I thus spent alone with the master of
the House of Usher. Yet I should
fail in any attempt to convey an idea
of the exact character of the studies,
or of the occupations, in which he
involved me, or led me the way. An
excited and highly distempered ideality
threw a sulphureous lustre over
all. His long, improvised dirges will
ring forever in my ears. Among
other things, I hold painfully in mind
a certain singular perversion and amplification
of the wild air of the last
waltz of Von Weber. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
paintings over which his elaborate
fancy brooded, and which grew, touch
by touch, into vaguenesses at which
I shuddered the more thrillingly because
I shuddered knowing not why,&mdash;from
these paintings (vivid as
their images now are before me) I
would in vain endeavor to educe more
than a small portion which should
lie within the compass of merely
written words. By the utter simplicity,
by the nakedness of his designs,
he arrested and overawed attention.
If ever mortal painted an
idea, that mortal was Roderick Usher.
For me at least, in the circumstances
then surrounding me, there arose,
out of the pure abstractions which
the hypochondriac contrived to throw
upon his canvas, an intensity of intolerable
awe, no shadow of which
felt I ever yet in the contemplation
of the certainly glowing yet too concrete
reveries of Fuseli.</p>

<p>17. One of the phantasmagoric conceptions
of my friend, partaking not
so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction,
may be shadowed forth, although
feebly, in words. A small
picture presented the interior of an
immensely long and rectangular vault
or tunnel, with low walls, smooth,
white, and without interruption or
device. Certain accessory points of
the design served well to convey the
idea that this excavation lay at an
exceeding depth below the surface of
the earth. No outlet was observed in
any portion of its vast extent, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
no torch, or other artificial source of
light, was discernible; yet a flood
of intense rays rolled throughout, and
bathed the whole in a ghastly and
inappropriate splendor.</p>

<p>18. I have just spoken of that
morbid condition of the auditory
nerve which rendered all music intolerable
to the sufferer, with the
exception of certain effects of
stringed instruments. It was, perhaps,
the narrow limits to which
he thus confined himself upon the
guitar, which gave birth, in great
measure, to the fantastic character
of his performances. But the fervid
<em>facility</em> of his impromptus could
not be so accounted for. They
must have been, and were, in the
notes as well as in the words of
his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently
accompanied himself
with rhymed verbal improvisations),
the result of that intense
mental collectedness and concentration
to which I have previously
alluded as observable only in particular
moments of the highest artificial
excitement. The words of
one of these rhapsodies I have
easily remembered. I was, perhaps,
the more forcibly impressed with
it as he gave it, because, in the
under or mystic current of its
meaning, I fancied that I perceived,
and for the first time, a full consciousness,
on the part of Usher, of
the tottering of his lofty reason
upon her throne. The verses, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
were entitled “The Haunted Palace,”
ran very nearly, if not accurately,
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">19. I well remember that suggestions
arising from this ballad led us
into a train of thought, wherein
there became manifest an opinion
of Usher’s which I mention, not so
much on account of its novelty (for
other men have thought thus) as
on account of the pertinacity with
which he maintained it. This opinion,
in its general form, was that
of the sentience of all vegetable
things. But in his disordered fancy,
the idea had assumed a more daring
character, and trespassed, under certain
conditions, upon the kingdom
of inorganization. I lack words to
express the full extent or the earnest
<em>abandon</em> of his persuasion.
The belief, however, was connected
(as I have previously hinted) with
the gray stones of the home of his
forefathers. The conditions of the
sentience had been here, he imagined,
fulfilled in the method of collocation
of these stones,&mdash;in the order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
of their arrangement, as well
as in that of the many fungi which
overspread them, and of the decayed
trees which stood around; above
all, in the long undisturbed endurance
of this arrangement, and in its
reduplication in the still waters of
the tarn. Its evidence&mdash;the evidence
of the sentience&mdash;was to be
seen, he said (and I here started
as he spoke), in the gradual yet certain
condensation of an atmosphere
of their own about the waters and
the walls. The result was discoverable,
he added, in that silent yet
importunate and terrible influence
which for centuries had moulded the
destinies of his family, and which
made <em>him</em> what I now saw him,&mdash;what
he was. Such opinions need
no comment, and I will make none.</p>

<p>20. Our books&mdash;the books which
for years had formed no small portion
of the mental existence of the
invalid&mdash;were, as might be supposed,
in strict keeping with this
character of phantasm. We pored
together over such works as the Ververt
and Chartreuse of Gresset; the
Belphegor of Machiavelli; the
Heaven and Hell of Swedenborg;
the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas
Klimm by Holberg; the Chiromancy
of Robert Flud, of Jean D’Indaginé,
and of De la Chambre; the Journey
into the Blue Distance of Tieck; and
the City of the Sun of Campanella.
One favorite volume was a small octavo
edition of the <em>Directorium Inquisitorum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span></em>,
by the Dominican Eymeric
de Gironne; and there were
passages in Pomponius Mela, about
the old African Satyrs and Ægipans,
over which Usher would sit dreaming
for hours. His chief delight, however,
was found in the perusal of
an exceedingly rare and curious book
in quarto Gothic,&mdash;the manual of a
forgotten church,&mdash;the <em>Vigilæ Mortuorum
secundum Chorum Ecclesiæ
Maguntinæ</em>.</p>

<p>21. I could not help thinking of the
wild ritual of this work, and of its
probable influence on the hypochondriac,
when one evening, having informed
me abruptly that the lady
Madeline was no more, he stated his
intention of preserving her corpse for
a fortnight (previously to its final interment),
in one of the numerous
vaults within the main walls of the
building. The worldly reason, however,
assigned for this singular proceeding
was one which I did not feel
at liberty to dispute. The brother had
been led to his resolution (so he told
me) by consideration of the unusual
character of the malady of the deceased,
of certain obtrusive and eager
inquiries on the part of her medical
men, and of the remote and exposed
situation of the burial-ground of the
family. I will not deny that when
I called to mind the sinister countenance
of the person whom I met upon
the staircase, on the day of my arrival
at the house, I had no desire to oppose
what I regarded as at best but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
a harmless, and by no means an unnatural,
precaution.</p>

<p>22. At the request of Usher, I personally
aided him in the arrangements
for the temporary entombment.
The body having been encoffined,
we two alone bore it to
its rest. The vault in which we
placed it (and which had been so
long unopened that our torches, half
smothered in its oppressive atmosphere,
gave us little opportunity for
investigation) was small, damp, and
entirely without means of admission
for light; lying, at great depth, immediately
beneath that portion of the
building in which was my own sleeping
apartment. It had been used
apparently, in remote feudal times,
for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep,
and in later days as a place
of deposit for powder, or some other
highly combustible substance, as a
portion of its floor, and the whole
interior of a long archway through
which we reached it, were carefully
sheathed with copper. The door,
of massive iron, had been also
similarly protected. Its immense
weight caused an unusually sharp
grating sound as it moved upon its
hinges.</p>

<p>23. Having deposited our mournful
burden upon tressels within this
region of horror, we partially turned
aside the yet unscrewed lid of the
coffin, and looked upon the face of
the tenant. A striking similitude
between the brother and sister now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
first arrested my attention; and
Usher, divining, perhaps, my
thoughts, murmured out some few
words from which I learned that the
deceased and himself had been
twins, and that sympathies of a
scarcely intelligible nature had always
existed between them. Our
glances, however, rested not long
upon the dead, for we could not regard
her unawed. The disease which
had thus entombed the lady in the
maturity of youth, had left, as usual
in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical
character, the mockery of a
faint blush upon the bosom and the
face, and that suspiciously lingering
smile upon the lip which is so terrible
in death. We replaced and
screwed down the lid, and having
secured the door of iron, made our
way, with toil, into the scarcely less
gloomy apartments of the upper portion
of the house.</p>

<p>24. And now, some days of bitter
grief having elapsed, an observable
change came over the features of
the mental disorder of my friend.
His ordinary manner had vanished.
His ordinary occupations were neglected
or forgotten. He roamed
from chamber to chamber with hurried,
unequal, and objectless step.
The pallor of his countenance had
assumed, if possible, a more ghastly
hue, but the luminousness of his eye
had utterly gone out. The once occasional
huskiness of his tone was
heard no more; and a tremulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually
characterized his utterance.
There were times, indeed, when I
thought his unceasingly agitated
mind was laboring with some oppressive
secret, to divulge which he
struggled for the necessary courage.
At times, again, I was obliged to
resolve all into the mere inexplicable
vagaries of madness, for I beheld
him gazing upon vacancy for
long hours, in an attitude of the
profoundest attention, as if listening
to some imaginary sound. It was
no wonder that his condition terrified&mdash;that
it infected me. I felt
creeping upon me, by slow yet certain
degrees, the wild influences of
his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.</p>

<p>25. It was, especially, upon retiring
to bed late in the night of the
seventh or eighth day after the placing
of the lady Madeline within the
donjon, that I experienced the full
power of such feelings. Sleep came
not near my couch, while the hours
waned and waned away. I struggled
to reason off the nervousness
which had dominion over me. I endeavored
to believe that much if not
all of what I felt was due to the
bewildering influence of the gloomy
furniture of the room,&mdash;of the dark
and tattered draperies which, tortured
into motion by the breath of a
rising tempest, swayed fitfully to
and fro upon the walls, and rustled
uneasily about the decorations of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
the bed. But my efforts were fruitless.
An irrepressible tremor gradually
pervaded my frame; and at
length there sat upon my very heart
an incubus of utterly causeless
alarm. Shaking this off with a gasp
and a struggle, I uplifted myself
upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly
within the intense darkness
of the chamber, hearkened&mdash;I know
not why, except that an instinctive
spirit prompted me&mdash;to certain low
and indefinite sounds which came,
through the pauses of the storm,
at long intervals, I knew not whence.
Overpowered by an intense sentiment
of horror, unaccountable yet
unendurable, I threw on my clothes
with haste (for I felt that I should
sleep no more during the night),
and endeavored to arouse myself
from the pitiable condition into
which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly
to and fro through the apartment.</p>

<p>26. I had taken but a few turns
in this manner, when a light step
on an adjoining staircase arrested
my attention. I presently recognized
it as that of Usher. In an
instant afterward he rapped with a
gentle touch at my door, and entered,
bearing a lamp. His countenance
was, as usual, cadaverously
wan&mdash;but, moreover, there was a
species of mad hilarity in his eyes,&mdash;an
evidently restrained hysteria
in his whole demeanor. His air appalled
me&mdash;but anything was preferable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
to the solitude which I had
so long endured, and I even welcomed
his presence as a relief.</p>

<p>27. “And you have not seen it?”
he said abruptly, after having stared
about him for some moments in silence,&mdash;“you
have not then seen it?&mdash;but,
stay! you shall.” Thus
speaking, and having carefully
shaded his lamp, he hurried to one
of the casements, and threw it freely
open to the storm.</p>

<p>28. The impetuous fury of the entering
gust nearly lifted us from our
feet. It was, indeed, a tempestuous
yet sternly beautiful night, and one
wildly singular in its terror and its
beauty. A whirlwind had apparently
collected its force in our vicinity, for
there were frequent and violent alterations
in the direction of the wind;
and the exceeding density of the clouds
(which hung so low as to press upon
the turrets of the house) did not prevent
our perceiving the life-like velocity
with which they flew careering
from all points against each
other, without passing away into the
distance. I say that even their exceeding
density did not prevent our
perceiving this; yet we had no
glimpse of the moon or stars, nor
was there any flashing forth of the
lightning. But the under surfaces
of the huge masses of agitated vapor,
as well as all terrestrial objects
immediately around us, were glowing
in the unnatural light of a faintly
luminous and distinctly visible gaseous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
exhalation which hung about
and enshrouded the mansion.</p>

<p>29. “You must not&mdash;you shall
not behold this!” said I shudderingly,
to Usher, as I led him with a
gentle violence from the window to
a seat. “These appearances, which
bewilder you, are merely electrical
phenomena not uncommon&mdash;or it
may be that they have their ghastly
origin in the rank miasma of the
tarn. Let us close this casement;
the air is chilling and dangerous to
your frame. Here is one of your
favorite romances. I will read, and
you shall listen;&mdash;and so we will
pass away this terrible night together.”</p>

<p>30. The antique volume which I
had taken up was the “Mad Trist”
of Sir Launcelot Canning; but I
had called it a favorite of Usher’s
more in sad jest than in earnest;
for, in truth, there is little in its
uncouth and unimaginative prolixity
which could have had interest
for the lofty and spiritual ideality
of my friend. It was, however, the
only book immediately at hand; and
I indulged a vague hope that the
excitement which now agitated the
hypochondriac might find relief (for
the history of mental disorder is
full of similar anomalies) even in
the extremeness of the folly which
I should read. Could I have
judged, indeed, by the wild, overstrained
air of vivacity with which
he hearkened, or apparently hearkened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
to the words of the tale, I
might well have congratulated myself
upon the success of my design.</p>

<p>31. I had arrived at that well-known
portion of the story where
Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having
sought in vain for peaceable admission
into the dwelling of the hermit,
proceeds to make good an entrance
by force. Here, it will be
remembered, the words of the narrative
run thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>32. “And Ethelred, who was by
nature of a doughty heart, and who
was now mighty withal on account
of the powerfulness of the wine
which he had drunken, waited no
longer to hold parley with the hermit,
who, in sooth, was of an obstinate
and maliceful turn, but, feeling the
rain upon his shoulders, and fearing
the rising of the tempest, uplifted
his mace outright and with blows
made quickly room in the plankings
of the door for his gauntleted hand;
and now, pulling therewith sturdily,
he so cracked, and ripped, and tore
all asunder, that the noise of the
dry and hollow-sounding wood
alarumed and reverberated throughout
the forest.”</p>

<p>33. At the termination of this sentence
I started, and for a moment
paused; for it appeared to me (although
I at once concluded that
my excited fancy had deceived me)&mdash;it
appeared to me that from some
very remote portion of the mansion
there came, indistinctly, to my ears,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
what might have been in its exact
similarity of character the echo (but
a stifled and dull one certainly) of
the very cracking and ripping
sound which Sir Launcelot had so
particularly described. It was, beyond
doubt, the coincidence alone
which had arrested my attention;
for, amid the rattling of the sashes
of the casements, and the ordinary
commingled noises of the still increasing
storm, the sound, in itself,
had nothing, surely, which should
have interested or disturbed me. I
continued the story:&mdash;</p>

<p>34. “But the good champion Ethelred,
now entering within the door,
was so enraged and amazed to perceive
no signal of the maliceful hermit;
but, in the stead thereof, a
dragon of a scaly and prodigious
demeanor, and of a fiery tongue,
which sate in guard before a palace
with a floor of silver; and upon the
wall there hung a shield of shining
brass with this legend enwritten:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container pw20 p11">
<div class="poetry">
<p class="small1">
Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;<br />
Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Ethelred uplifted his mace,
struck upon the head of the dragon,
which fell before him, and gave up
his pesty breath, with a shriek so
horrid and harsh, and withal so
piercing, that Ethelred had fain to
close his ears with his hands against
the dreadful noise of it, the like
whereof was never before heard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span></p>

<p>35. Here again I paused abruptly,
and now with a feeling of wild
amazement, for there could be no
doubt whatever that, in this instance,
I did actually hear (although from
what direction it proceeded I found
it impossible to say) a low and apparently
distant, but harsh, protracted,
and most unusual screaming
or grating sound,&mdash;the exact counterpart
of what my fancy had already
conjured up for the dragon’s unnatural
shriek as described by the
romancer.</p>

<p>36. Oppressed as I certainly was,
upon the occurrence of this second
and most extraordinary coincidence,
by a thousand conflicting sensations,
in which wonder and extreme terror
were predominant, I still retained
sufficient presence of mind to avoid
exciting, by any observation, the sensitive
nervousness of my companion.
I was by no means certain
that he had noticed the sounds in
question; although, assuredly, a
strange alteration had during the
last few minutes taken place in his
demeanor. From a position fronting
my own, he had gradually brought
round his chair, so as to sit with
his face to the door of the chamber;
and thus I could but partially perceive
his features, although I saw
that his lips trembled as if he were
murmuring inaudibly. His head
had dropped upon his breast; yet I
knew that he was not asleep, from
the wide and rigid opening of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
eye as I caught a glance of it in
profile. The motion of his body,
too, was at variance with this idea,
for he rocked from side to side
with a gentle yet constant and uniform
sway. Having rapidly taken
notice of all this, I resumed the narrative
of Sir Launcelot, which thus
proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>37. “And now the champion, having
escaped from the terrible fury
of the dragon, bethinking himself
of the brazen shield, and of the
breaking up of the enchantment
which was upon it, removed the carcass
from out of the way before him,
and approached valorously over the
silver pavement of the castle to
where the shield was upon the wall;
which in sooth tarried not for his
full coming, but fell down at his feet
upon the silver floor, with a mighty
great and terrible ringing sound.”</p>

<p>38. No sooner had these syllables
passed my lips than&mdash;as if a shield
of brass had indeed, at the moment,
fallen heavily upon a floor of
silver&mdash;I became aware of a distinct,
hollow, metallic, and clangorous
yet apparently muffled reverberation.
Completely unnerved, I
leaped to my feet; but the measured
rocking movement of Usher was undisturbed.
I rushed to the chair in
which he sat. His eyes were bent
fixedly before him, and throughout
his whole countenance there reigned
a stony rigidity. But, as I placed
my hand upon his shoulder, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
came a strong shudder over his
whole person; a sickly smile quivered
about his lips; and I saw that
he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering
murmur, as if unconscious
of my presence. Bending closely
over him, I at length drank in the
hideous import of his words.</p>

<p>39. “Not hear it?&mdash;yes, I hear
it, and <em>have</em> heard it. Long&mdash;long&mdash;long&mdash;many
minutes, many
hours, many days, have I heard it,
yet I dared not&mdash;oh, pity me, miserable
wretch that I am!&mdash;I dared
not&mdash;I <em>dared</em> not speak! <em>We have
put her living in the tomb!</em> Said
I not that my senses were acute?
I <em>now</em> tell you that I heard her first
feeble movements in the hollow coffin.
I heard them&mdash;many, many
days ago&mdash;yet I dared not&mdash;<em>I
dared not speak!</em> And now&mdash;to-night&mdash;Ethelred&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;the
breaking of the hermit’s door, and
the death-cry of the dragon, and
the clangor of the shield!&mdash;say
rather, the rending of her coffin, and
the grating of the iron hinges of her
prison, and her struggles within the
coppered archway of the vault!
Oh, whither shall I fly? Will she
not be here anon? Is she not hurrying
to upbraid me for my haste?
Have I not heard her footsteps on
the stair? Do I not distinguish that
heavy and horrible beating of her
heart? Madman!”&mdash;here he sprang
furiously to his feet, and shrieked
out his syllables, as if in the effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
he were giving up his soul&mdash;“<em>Madman!
I tell you that she now stands
without the door!</em>”</p>

<p>40. As if in the superhuman energy
of his utterance there had been
found the potency of a spell, the
huge antique panels to which the
speaker pointed threw slowly back,
upon the instant, their ponderous
and ebony jaws. It was the work
of the rushing gust&mdash;but then
without those doors there <em>did</em> stand
the lofty and enshrouded figure of
the lady Madeline of Usher! There
was blood upon her white robes,
and the evidence of some bitter
struggle upon every portion of her
emaciated frame. For a moment
she remained trembling and reeling
to and fro upon the threshold&mdash;then,
with a low moaning cry, fell
heavily inward upon the person of
her brother, and, in her violent and
now final death agonies, bore him
to the floor a corpse, and a victim
to the terrors he had anticipated.</p>

<p>41. From that chamber and from
that mansion I fled aghast. The
storm was still abroad in all its wrath
as I found myself crossing the old
causeway. Suddenly there shot
along the path a wild light, and I
turned to see whence a gleam so
unusual could have issued; for the
vast house and its shadows were
alone behind me. The radiance was
that of the full, setting, and blood-red
moon, which now shone vividly
through that once barely discernible
fissure, of which I have before
spoken as extending from the roof
of the building, in a zigzag direction,
to the base. While I gazed,
this fissure rapidly widened&mdash;there
came a fierce breath of the whirlwind&mdash;the
entire orb of the satellite
burst at once upon my sight&mdash;my
brain reeled as I saw the mighty
walls rushing asunder&mdash;there was
a long, tumultuous shouting sound
like the voice of a thousand waters&mdash;and
the deep and dank tarn at my
feet closed sullenly and silently over
the fragments of the “<em>House of
Usher</em>.”</p>

to meet another friend of his, we take it for granted that
our friend has reasons for believing that the acquaintanceship

<h3>CHARACTER STUDIES</h3>

<p>A character-study, whether in the form of a sketch, a
tale, or a short-story, attempts to reveal individual human
nature by the unfolding of the story.</p>

<p>In the sketch it will be a photograph of character in a
striking mood, under stress of emotion, or just before,
or during, or after a crisis that is peculiarly suited to
showing either the full character or one of its interesting
phases. Some photographs consist of bold masses of
light and shade, others are so handled as to bring out a
multitude of details. The sketch allows in a literary way
the same methods of treatment, but the typical sketch
avoids unnecessary minutiæ.</p>

<p>The tale is also a photograph, but instead of being a
single stationary picture, it is a moving-picture, delineating
character by a chain of incidents which allow us to
see what the characters are by what they do. True to
the type of the tale, it does not deal with character crisis,
but merely reveals character in a series of illuminating
deeds.</p>

<p>In the character short-story the author’s method is
more complicated, for the whole mechanism of the story&mdash;introduction,
plot, dialogue, and conclusion&mdash;are designed
to show us the characters under stress of emotion
and the results of that emotional arousement. We learn
the characters of the characters&mdash;for there is a distinction
here&mdash;by seeing how they act upon each other, how
they solve problems, how they meet the crises of life&mdash;what
effect trouble or joy has upon them&mdash;and the final
outcome of it all. It is like studying a human being
while he is being subjected to a test, and observing the
development of his character, or its failure to stand the
test, in that critical moment.</p>

<p>By this it will be seen that a character-study is a story
with a purpose&mdash;a purpose deeper than that of affording
entertainment from the plot. The finest stories are those
which so interest us in the action, or plot, of the story
proper that the profound character disclosures and
changes are borne in upon us while we are watching the
progress of the story. It is this subtle balance of narrative
and character-study which presents the story-teller’s
art at its best.</p>

and station in life
of the characters.</div>

<p class="p1">On all the roads around Goderville
the peasants and their wives
were coming towards the town, for
it was market-day. The men swung
along at an easy gait, their whole
bodies swaying forward with every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
movement of their long, twisted legs&mdash;legs
misshapen by hard work: by
holding down the plough, which <span class="sidenote">Minute observation.</span>
throws up the left shoulder while
it deforms the figure; by mowing
grain, the effort of which spreads
the knees too wide apart to permit
them to stand quite steady; by all
the tedious and laborious tasks of
the fields. Their blue blouses,
starched and glossy as though varnished,
and decorated at collar and
cuffs with neat designs in white
stitching, puffed out about their
bony forms just like balloons all
ready to rise, from which protruded
a head, two arms, and two legs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Characterization.</div>

<p>2. Some of the men were leading
a cow or a calf at the end of a rope.
Following close behind, the wives
switched the animals over the back
with branches still covered with
leaves, in order to quicken their
pace. The women carried on their
arms great baskets from which the
heads of chickens and ducks protruded,<span class="sidenote">Local-color by character description.</span>
and they walked with a
shorter, quicker step than the men&mdash;each
withered figure erect and
wrapped in a scanty little shawl
pinned across her flat bosom, each
head done up in a white cloth,
bound close about the hair and surmounted
by a cap.</p>

<p>3. Now a wagonette passed, drawn
by a nag at a fitful trot, grotesquely
shaking up the two men seated side
by side, and the woman in the back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
of the vehicle, who clutched its sides

<p>4. In the Goderville market-place
there was a great crowd&mdash;a medley
of man and beast. The horns
of the cattle, the high, long-napped
hats of the prosperous peasants, and
the head-dresses of the women, rose
above the level of the throng. And
the voices&mdash;sharp, shrill, squawking&mdash;rose
in a wild, incessant
clamor, which was dominated now
and then by a great guffaw of laughter
emitted from the robust chest
of some sturdy bumpkin, or by the
long-drawn-out lowing of a cow
tethered to the wall of a house.</p>

<p>5. Everything there smelled of
the stable&mdash;the milk, the manure, the
hay, the sweat, gave forth that acrid,
offensive odor of man and animal
so peculiar to dwellers of the fields.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Chief Character.</span></div>

<p id="para6">6. Master Hauchecorne, of
Bréauté, had just arrived at Goderville,
and was moving toward the
square, when he observed a little
piece of string on the ground.
Economical, like a true Norman, <span class="sidenote">The Normans are said to be
typically “ambitious, positive,
bold, tricky, economical.”</span>
Master Hauchecorne thought that
everything which could be used was
worth saving; so he stooped down
painfully, for he suffered from rheumatism,
picked up from the dirt
the insignificant scrap of twine,
and was just about to roll it <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Foundation Plot Incident.</span></span>
up with care when he noticed Master
Malandin, the harness-maker,
standing on his doorstep looking at
him. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Chief Complication.</span></span>Once the two men had had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
a difference over the matter of a halter,
and ever since they had remained
angry with each other, cherishing
their spite. Master Hauchecorne
was seized with a sort of
shame at having his enemy thus see
him searching in the mud for a mere
scrap of string. He therefore hastily <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Resultant Complication.</span></span>
hid away his find in his blouse,
and then in his breeches-pocket.
At the same time he pretended to
be still searching in the dirt for
something which he had not been
able to find. Finally he moved on
toward the market-place, his head
thrust forward, his body bent double
by his pains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Local-color.</div>

<p>7. In a moment he was lost in
the slowly shifting, noisy throng,
agitated by its own constant chafferings.
The peasants felt of the cows,
turned away, came back again,
much puzzled&mdash;always fearful of
being over-reached in the bargain,
never reaching a decision, watching
the eye of the vendor,  <span class="sidenote">See note on <a href="#para6">¶6</a>.</span> seeking ever
to unmask the ruse of the man and
the defect in his animal.</p>

<p>8. The women, having set their
huge baskets at their feet, took out
their poultry, which they laid on
the ground with legs tied together,
terror-stricken eyes, and scarlet
combs.</p>

<p>9. They listened to offers, maintaining
their price with a keen air
but impassive face, or else suddenly
deciding to take the counter offer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
crying out to the slowly retreating
customer:</p>

<p>10. “It’s settled, Master Anthime,
I’ll give them to you!”</p>

<p>11. At length, little by little, the
square became empty, and when the
Angelus sounded noon, those who
lived too far away to go home repaired
to the inns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Setting for main crisis.</div>

<p>12. At Jourdain’s, the large hall
was crowded with diners, while the
great courtyard was full of vehicles
of every sort&mdash;carts, gigs, wagonettes,
tilburies, traps, nameless carriages,
yellow with mud, shapeless,
patched, shafts pointing to heaven
like two arms, or with noses in the
ground and backs in the air.</p>

<p>13. Right opposite the diners at
table, the immense fireplace, all
brightly aflame, cast a lively warmth
on the backs of those ranged along
the right. Three spits were turning,
laden with chickens, pigeons, and
legs of mutton; and a delectable odor
of roasting meat, and of juices
streaming over the browned skin,
rose from the hearth, kindled good
humor and made everyone’s mouth
water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note how the author gathers
the people to witness
the crisis.</div>

<p>14. All the aristocracy of the
plough were eating there, at <em>Maît’
Jourdain’s</em>,<span class="sidenote"><em>Maît’</em>&mdash;colloquial abbreviation
for <em>Maître</em>, equal
here to “Mine Host.”</span> inn-keeper and horse-trader&mdash;a
sly fellow who had made
money.</p>

<p>15. The dishes went round, and,
like the jugs of yellow cider, were
emptied. Everyone told of his affairs:
his sales and his purchases.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
They exchanged news of the crops&mdash;the
weather was good for vegetables,
but a trifle wet for wheat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Approach of crisis.</div>

<p>16. Suddenly the roll of a drum
sounded in the courtyard before
the house. Instantly everyone was
on his feet,<span class="sidenote">Typical of their class.</span> save a few indifferent
ones, and ran to the door or to
the windows, with mouth still full
and napkin in hand.</p>

<p>17. After the public crier had
ended his tattoo, he shouted out in a
jerky voice, making his pauses at
the wrong time:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparation for crisis.</div>

<p>18. “Be it known to the people
of Goderville, and in general to all&mdash;persons
present at the market, that
there was lost this morning, upon
the Beuzeville road between&mdash;nine
and ten o’clock, a black leather
pocketbook, containing five hundred
francs and some business papers.
You are requested to return it&mdash;to
the mayor’s office, without delay, or
to Master Fortuné Houlbrèque of
Manneville. There will be twenty
francs reward.”</p>

<p>19. Then the man went away.
Once again was heard afar the muffled
roll of the drum and the faint
voice of the crier.</p>

<p>20. Then they began to talk over
the incident, estimating the chances
Master Houlbrèque had of recovering
or of not recovering his pocketbook.
Meanwhile the meal went on.</p>

<p>21. They were finishing coffee
when the corporal of gendarmes appeared
in the doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span></p>

<p>22. He asked:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Closer approach of crisis.</div>

<p>23. “Master Hauchecorne of
Bréauté&mdash;is he here?”</p>

<p>24. Master Hauchecorne, who was
seated at the other end of the table,
replied:</p>

<p>25. “That’s me.”</p>

<p>26. And the corporal replied:</p>

<p>27. “Master Hauchecorne, will you
have the goodness to go with me to
the mayor’s office. <em>Monsieur le
maire</em> would like to speak with
you.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note how throughout the
author emphasizes physical
characteristics as indicating
character.<br />
Minute observation.</div>

<p>28. The peasant&mdash;surprised, disturbed&mdash;drained
his glass at a
gulp, got up, and, more doubled up
than in the morning, because the
first steps after a rest were always
particularly difficult, he started off,
repeating:</p>

<p>29. “That’s me, that’s me,” and
he followed the corporal.</p>

<p>30. The mayor was awaiting him,
seated in an armchair. He was the
notary of the place, a large man,
grave, and pompous in speech.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Full Crisis.</span></div>

<p>31. “Master Hauchecorne,” said
he, “you were seen to pick up this
morning, on the Beuzeville road,
the pocketbook lost by Master
Houlbrèque, of Manneville.”</p>

<p>32. The countryman, speechless,
stared at the mayor, already terrified
by this suspicion which rested
upon him without his understanding
why.</p>

<p>33. “Me, me, I picked up that
pocketbook?”</p>

<p>34. “Yes, exactly you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span></p>

<p>35. “Word of honor, I ain’t even
so much as seen it.”</p>

<p>36. “You were seen.”</p>

<p>37. “They saw me, me? Who’s it
'as seen me?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note how the complication
is involved by personal
prejudice.</div>

<p>38. “Monsieur Malandin, the harness-maker.”</p>

<p>39. Then the old man remembered,
and understood. Reddening with
rage, he cried:</p>

<p>40. “Ah! he saw me, that cad!
He saw me pick up this here string&mdash;look,
<em>m’sieu le maire</em>.”</p>

<p>41. And, fumbling at the bottom
of his pocket, he pulled out the
little bit of cord.</p>

<p>42. But the mayor, incredulous,
shook his head.</p>

<p>43. “You will not make me believe,
Master Hauchecorne, that
Monsieur Malandin, who is a man
worthy of belief, has mistaken that
bit of string for a pocketbook.”</p>

<p>44. The peasant, furious, raised
his hand and spat to one side, thus
to attest his honor, repeating:</p>

<p>45. “All the same it’s the truth of
the good God, the holy truth, <em>m’sieu
le maire</em>. There! Upon my soul and
my salvation, I say it again.”</p>

<p>46. The mayor replied:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Circumstantial evidence. The
miser’s character helps
condemn him unjustly.</div>

<p>47. “After having picked the thing
up, you even hunted a long time in
the mud to see if some piece of
money had not fallen out.”</p>

<p>48. The good man choked with indignation
and fear.</p>

<p>49. “How can anyone tell&mdash;how
can anyone tell&mdash;lies like that to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
misrepresent an honest man! How
can anyone tell&mdash;”</p>

<p>50. However he might protest, no
one believed him.</p>

<p>51. He was confronted with Monsieur
Malandin, who repeated and
sustained his affirmation. They railed
at each other for a whole hour.
At his own request, Master Hauchecorne
was searched. They found
nothing upon him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Suspense.</div>

<p>52. At last, the mayor, greatly
perplexed, sent him away, with the
warning that he would advise the
public prosecutor, and ask for orders.</p>

<p>53. The news had spread. When
he came out of the mayor’s office the
old man was surrounded and questioned
with a curiosity either serious
or bantering, but into which not the
least indignation entered. And he
began to recount the history of the
piece of string. No one believed
him. They laughed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tone of story.</div>

<p>54. He went on, halted by everyone,
stopping his acquaintances, renewing
endlessly his recital and his
protestations, showing his pockets
turned inside out to prove that he
had nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note Maupassant’s use of
the short paragraph.</div>

<p>55. They said to him:</p>

<p>56. “G’long, you old rascal!”</p>

<p>57. And he grew angry, working
himself into exasperation, into a
fever, desperate at not being believed,
not knowing what to do, and always
repeating his story.</p>

<p>58. Night came on. He must go
home. He started out with three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
neighbors to whom he showed the
place where he had picked up
the piece of string; and all along the
road he kept talking of his adventure.</p>

<p>59. That evening, he made a round
of the village of Bréauté, in order to
tell everyone of the matter. He encountered
none but unbelievers.</p>

<p>60. He was ill of it all night.</p>

<p>61. The next day, about one o’clock
in the afternoon, Marius Paumelle,
a farm-hand of Master Breton’s, the
market-gardener at Ymauville, returned
the pocketbook and its contents
to Master Houlbrèque, of
Manneville.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Apparent resolution of the
complication.</div>

<p>62. This man asserted, in substance,
that he had found the article on the
road; but, not being able to read,
he had carried it home and given it
to his employer.</p>

<p>63. The news spread to the suburbs.
Master Hauchecorne was informed
of it. He set himself at once to
journeying about and commenced to
narrate his story as completed by
the denouement. He was triumphant.</p>

<p>64. “Wha’ made me feel bad,” he
said, “wasn’t the thing itself, you
understand, but it was the lies.
There’s nothing hurts you like being
blamed for a lie.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tone of story.</div>



<p>65. All day long he talked of his
adventure, he recounted it on the
roadways to the people who passed,
at the tavern to the folks who drank,
at the dismissal of church on the following
Sunday. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Foundation for Climax.</span></span> He even button-holed
strangers to tell it to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Resultant Complication.</span></div>

<p>Now, he was tranquil, and yet something
else bothered him without his
being able to tell precisely what.
People did not seem to be convinced.
He felt as if they gossiped behind
his back.</p>

<p>66. On Tuesday of the following
week, he went to the Goderville
market, solely impelled by the desire
to relate his story. Malandin, standing
in his doorway, began to laugh
when he saw him pass. Why?</p>

<p>67. He accosted a farmer of Criquetot
who would not let him finish,
but giving him a dig in the pit of
the stomach, cried out in his face,
“G’long, you great rogue!” Then
he turned on his heel.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Peasant simplicity.</div>

<p>68. Master Hauchecorne stood
speechless, growing more and more
disturbed. Why had he called him
“great rogue”?</p>

<p>69. When seated at table at Jourdain’s
tavern, he again began to explain
the affair.</p>

<p>70. A Montivilliers horse-dealer
called out to him:</p>

<p>71. “Go on, go on, you old trickster,
I know you, and your piece of
string!”</p>

<p>72. Hauchecorne stammered, “But&mdash;they&mdash;found
it, the pocketbook!”</p>

<p>73. But the other retorted:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Denouement as to the
resultant complication.</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Final Complication.</span></div>

<p>74. “Be quiet, daddy! There’s
one who finds it, and one who takes
it back. No one sees it, no one recognizes
it, no one is the wiser for it.”</p>

<p>75. The peasant sat dumbfounded.
He understood at last. They accused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
him of having returned the pocketbook
by a confederate, an accomplice.</p>

<p>76. He tried to protest. Everyone
at the table began to laugh.</p>

<p>77. He could not finish his dinner,
and left amidst their mockeries.</p>

<p>78. He returned home, ashamed
and indignant, strangled by his
anger, by his confusion, and all the
more thunderstruck because, with his
Norman cunning, he was quite capable
of having done the thing of
which they had accused him, and
even of boasting of it as a good trick.<span class="sidenote">Key.</span>
It appeared to him confusedly as impossible
to prove his innocence, for
his trickery was well known. And
he felt struck to the heart with the
injustice of the suspicion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tone.</div>

<p>79. Again he began to tell of his
adventure, every day lengthening his
recital, advancing each time new
proofs, more energetic protestations,
and more solemn oaths which he
conjured up in his hours of solitude&mdash;his
mind was occupied solely by
the story of the piece of string.<span class="sidenote">Key.</span>
They believed him all the less as
his defense became more complicated
and his reasoning more fine-spun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Complication summarized.</div>

<p>80. “Ha, they are liar’s reasons!”
they said behind his back.</p>

<p>81. He realized it; he fretted over
it; he exhausted himself in futile
efforts.</p>

<p>82. He visibly wasted away.</p>

<p>83. The wags now made him recite
“The Piece of String” for their
amusement, as one persuades a soldier
who has been through a campaign,
to tell the story of his battles. His
mind, attacked at its foundations,
began to totter.</p>

<p>84. Towards the end of December
he took to his bed.</p>

<p>85. During the first days of January
he died, and, in the delirium of
his mortal agony he protested his innocence,
repeating:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Climax.</span></div>

<p>86. “&mdash;a li’l’ piece of string ...
a li’l’ piece of string ... see, here
it is, <em>m’sieu le maire</em>.”</p>

<h3>COPPÉE AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>François Edouard Joachim Coppée was born in Paris,
January 12, 1842. He was educated at the <em>Lycée St.
Louis</em>, and early attracted attention by his poetic gifts.
He held office as Librarian of the Senate, and also
Guardian of the Archives at the <em>Comédie Française</em>.
The honors of membership in the French Academy and
that of being decorated with the Cross of the Legion of
Honor were given him in 1883 and 1888 respectively.
He died May 23, 1908.</p>

<p>François Coppée was a poet, dramatist, and short-story
writer. The collection <em>Poèmes Modernes</em>, published at
the age of twenty-seven, contains some remarkable work
which well represents his talent. The plays <em>Madame de
Maintenon</em> and <em>Le Luthier de Crémone</em> rank with his
best dramatic work. Among his short-story gems are
“The Sabots of Little Wolff,” “At Table,” “Two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
Clowns,” “The Captain’s Vices,” “My Friend Meurtrier,”
“An Accident,” and “The Substitute.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As a novelist, Coppée left no permanent mark upon
his times, for in this field he was far surpassed by his
contemporaries; but as a writer of little prose fictions, he
stands well forward among that brilliant group which
includes those immortals of the short-story&mdash;Maupassant,
Daudet, and Mérimée. From the work of these
masters, Coppée’s is well distinguished. The Norman
Maupassant drew his lines with a sharper pencil, and, by
the same token, an infinitely harder one; Daudet, child
of Provence though he was, dipped his stylus more often
in the acid of satire; and the Parisian Mérimée, though
nearer than any other to Coppée in his manner of work,
was less in sympathy with his own characters than the
warmer-hearted author of “The Sabots of Little Wolff”
and “The Substitute”&mdash;which follows in a translation
by the author of this volume. Coppée was almost an
idealist&mdash;certainly he was quick to respond to the call
of the ideal in his themes. Amidst so much that is
sordid and gross in French fiction, how refreshing it is
to read a master who could be truthful without wallowing,
moral without sermonizing, compassionate without
sniveling, humorous without buffooning, and always disclose
in his stories the spirit of a sympathetic lover of
mankind. Like Dickens, he chose the lowly for his characters,
and like Dickens, he found poetry in their simple
lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In common with other modern French writers, with Daudet,
Maupassant, and others, Coppée excels in the writing of tales.
His prose is remarkable for the same qualities that appear in
his poetical works: sympathy, tenderness, marked predilection
for the weak, the humble, and especially a masterly treatment of
subjects essentially Parisian and modern.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Robert Sanderson</span>,
<em>François Coppée</em>, in <span class="smcap">Warner’s</span> <em>Library of the World’s Best
Literature</em>.</p>

<p>Compassion is the chief quality of this little masterpiece,&mdash;compassion
and understanding of a primitive type of character.
The author shows us the good in a character not altogether bad;
and he almost makes us feel that the final sacrifice was justifiable.
He succeeds in doing this chiefly because he shows us the
other characters only as they appeared to Jean François, thus
focusing the interest of the reader on this single character.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Brander
Matthews</span>, <em>The Short-story</em>.</p>

<p>More than Daudet, Coppée deserves the title of the French
Dickens. A fellow member of the French Academy, José de
Heredia, calls him “the poet of the humble, painting with sincere
emotion his profound sympathy for the sorrows, the miseries,
and the sacrifices of the meek.” As an artist in fiction,
says Heredia, “Coppée possesses preëminently the gift of presenting
concrete fact rather than abstraction,” and a “great
grasp of character,” enabling him “to show us the human heart
and intellect in full play and activity”&mdash;both of which endowments
were the supreme characteristics of the author of <em>Nicholas
Nickleby</em> and <em>David Copperfield</em>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Merion M. Miller</span>, Introduction
to <em>The Guilty Man</em>.</p>

<p>Contrast the touching pathos of the “Substitute,” poignant in
his magnificent self-sacrifice, by which the man who has conquered
his shameful past goes back willingly to the horrible life
he has fled from, that he may save from a like degradation and
from an inevitable moral decay the one friend he has in the
world, all unworthy as this friend is&mdash;contrast this with the
story of the gigantic deeds “My Friend Meurtrier” boasts about
unceasingly, not knowing that he has been discovered in his
little round of daily domestic duties&mdash;making the coffee of his
good old mother, and taking her poodle out for a walk....
No doubt M. Coppée’s <em>contes</em> [stories] have not the sharpness
of Maupassant’s nor the brilliancy of M. Daudet’s. But what of
it? They have qualities of their own. They have sympathy,
poetry, and a power of suggesting pictures not exceeded, I think,
by those of either Maupassant or M. Daudet. M. Coppée’s street
views in Paris, his interiors, his impressionist sketches of life
under the shadow of Notre Dame, are convincingly successful.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Brander
Matthews</span>, <em>Aspects of Fiction</em>.</p>

<p class="p1">He was scarcely ten years old
when he was first arrested as a vagabond.</p>

and for six months now I’ve
been with the man who sings between
two lanterns on the Place de la Bastille,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
while he scrapes on a string of
catgut. I repeat the chorus with him,
and then I cry out, ‘Get the collection
of new songs, ten centimes, two
sous!’ He was always drunk and
beat me; that’s why the police found
me the other night, in the tumble-down
buildings. Before that, I used
to be with the man who sells brushes.
My mother was a laundress; she called
herself Adèle. At one time a
gentleman had given her an establishment,
on the ground-floor, at Montmartre.
She was a good worker and
loved me well. She made money because
she had the clientele of the
café waiters, and those people use
lots of linen. Sundays, she would
put me to bed early to go to the ball;
but week days, she sent me to the
Brothers’ school, where I learned to
read. Well, at last the <em>sergent-de-ville</em>
whose beat was up our street,
began always stopping before her
window to talk to her&mdash;a fine fellow,
with the Crimean medal. They
got married, and all went wrong.
He didn’t take to me, and set mamma
against me. Every one boxed
my ears; and it was then that, to get
away from home, I spent whole days
on the Place Clichy, where I got to
know the mountebanks. My stepfather
lost his place, mamma her
customers; she went to the wash-house
to support her man. It was
there she got consumption&mdash;from
the steam of the lye. She died at
Lariboisière. She was a good woman.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
Since that time I’ve lived with
the brush-seller and the catgut-scraper.
Are you going to put me in
prison?”</p>

<p>4. He talked this way openly, cynically,
like a man. He was a ragged
little rascal, as tall as a boot, with his
forehead hidden under a strange mop
of yellow hair.</p>

<p>5. Nobody claimed him, so they
sent him to the Reform School.</p>

<p>6. Not very intelligent, lazy, above
all maladroit with his hands, he was
able to learn there only a poor trade&mdash;the
reseating of chairs. Yet he
was obedient, of a nature passive and
taciturn, and he did not seem to have
been too profoundly corrupted in that
school of vice. But when, having
come to his seventeenth year, he was
set free again on the streets of Paris,
he found there, for his misfortune,
his prison comrades, all dreadful
rascals, exercising their low callings.
Some were trainers of dogs
for catching rats in the sewers;
some shined shoes on ball nights
in the Passage de l’Opéra; some
were amateur wrestlers, who let
themselves be thrown by the Hercules
of the side-shows; some fished from
rafts out in the river, in the full
sunlight. He tried all these things
a little, and a few months after he
had left the house of correction he
was arrested anew for a petty theft:
a pair of old shoes lifted from out an
open shop-window. Result: a year
of prison at Sainte-Pélagie, where he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
served as valet to the political prisoners.</p>


<p>7. He lived, astonished, among this
group of prisoners, all very young
and negligently clad, who talked in
loud voices and carried their heads
in such a solemn way. They used to
meet in the cell of the eldest of them,
a fellow of some thirty years, already
locked up for a long time and apparently
settled at Sainte-Pélagie: a
large cell it was, papered with colored
caricatures, and from whose windows
one could see all Paris&mdash;its
roofs, its clock-towers, and its domes,
and far off, the distant line of the
hills, blue and vague against the sky.
There were upon the walls several
shelves filled with books, and all the
old apparatus of a <em>salle d’armes</em>&mdash;broken
masks, rusty foils, leather
jackets, and gloves that were losing
their stuffing. It was there that the
“politicians” dined together, adding
to the inevitable “soup and beef”
some fruit, cheese, and half-pints of
wine that Jean François went out to
buy in a can&mdash;tumultuous repasts,
interrupted by violent disputes, <span class="sidenote">Revolutionary songs of 1793.</span>
where they sang in chorus at the
dessert the <em>Carmagnole</em> and <em>Ça ira</em>.
They took on, however, an air of
dignity on days when they made place
for a newcomer, who was at first
gravely treated as “<em>citizen</em>,” but who
was the next day <span class="sidenote"><em>Tu</em>&mdash;thou&mdash;used only in
familiar address.</span><em>tutoyed</em>, and called
by his nickname. They used big
words there&mdash;Corporation, Solidarity,
and phrases all quite unintelligible
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
to Jean François, such as this,
for example, which he once heard
uttered imperiously by a frightful little
hunchback who scribbled on paper
all night long:</p>

<p>8. “It is settled. The cabinet is to
be thus composed: Raymond in the
Department of Education, Martial in
the Interior, and I in Foreign Affairs.”</p>

<p>9. Having served his time, he wandered
again about Paris, under the
surveillance of the police, in the fashion
of beetles that cruel children keep
flying at the end of a string. He had
become one of those fugitive and
timid beings whom the law, with a
sort of coquetry, arrests and releases,
turn and turn about, a little like those
platonic fishermen who, so as not
to empty the pond, throw back into
the water the fish just out of the net.
Without his suspecting that so much
honor was done to his wretched
personality, he had a special docket
in the mysterious archives of <span class="sidenote">Police headquarters.</span><em>la rue
de Jérusalem</em>, his name and surnames
were written in a large back-hand
on the gray paper of the cover,
and the notes and reports, carefully
classified, gave him these graded appellations:
“the man named Leturc,”
“the prisoner Leturc,” and at last
“the convicted Leturc.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The California, a cheap eating-house
in Paris.</div>

<p>10. He stayed two years out of
prison, dining <em>à la Californie</em>, sleeping
in lodging-houses, and sometimes in
lime-kilns, and taking part with his
fellows in endless games of pitch-penny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
on the boulevards near the
city gates. He wore a greasy cap
on the back of his head, carpet slippers,
and a short white blouse.
When he had five sous, he had his
hair curled. He danced at Constant’s
at Montparnasse; bought for two
sous the jack-of-hearts or the ace-of-spades,
which were used as return
checks, to resell them for four sous
at the door of Bobino; opened carriage-doors
as occasion offered; led
about sorry nags at the horse-market.<span class="sidenote">In drawing lots for military
service the higher numbers
give exemption, and
this he secured by drawing
“a good number.”</span>
Of all the bad luck&mdash;in the conscription
he drew a good number. Who
knows whether the atmosphere of
honor which is breathed in a regiment,
whether military discipline,
might not have saved him? Caught
in a haul of the police-net with the
younger vagabonds who used to rob
the drunkards asleep in the streets,
he denied very energetically having
taken part in their expeditions. It
was perhaps true. But his antecedents
were accepted in lieu of proof,
and he was sent up for three years
to Poissy. There he had to make
rough toys, had himself tattooed on
the chest, and learned thieves’ slang
and the penal code. A new liberation,
a new plunge into the Parisian
sewer, but very short this time, for
at the end of hardly six weeks he
was again compromised in a theft
by night, aggravated by violent entry,
a doubtful case in which he
played an <span class="sidenote">A receiver of stolen goods.</span> obscure rôle, half dupe
and half fence. On the whole, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
complicity seemed evident, and he
was condemned to five years’ hard
labor. His sorrow in this adventure
was, chiefly, to be separated from an
old dog which he had picked up on
a heap of rubbish and cured of the
mange. This beast loved him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Straw was stuffed into the
sabots to cushion the feet.</div>

<p>11. Toulon, the ball on his ankle,
the work in the harbor, the blows
from the staves, the wooden shoes
without straw, the soup of black
beans dating from Trafalgar, no
money for tobacco, and the horrible
sleep on the filthy camp-bed of the
galley slave, that is what he knew
for five torrid summers and five winters
blown upon by the <span class="sidenote">The northwest storm-wind
from the Mediterranean.</span><em>Mistral</em>. He
came out from there stunned, and
was sent under surveillance to Vernon,
where he worked for some time
on the river; then, an incorrigible
vagabond, he broke exile and returned
again to Paris.</p>

<p>12. He had his savings, fifty-six
francs&mdash;that is to say, time enough
to reflect. During his long absence,
his old and horrible comrades had
been dispersed. He was well hidden,
and slept in a loft at an old woman’s,
to whom he had represented himself
as a sailor weary of the sea, having
lost his papers in a recent shipwreck,
and who wished to essay another
trade. His tanned face, his calloused
hands, and a few nautical terms he
let fall one time or another, made
this story sufficiently probable.</p>

<p>13. One day when he had risked a
saunter along the streets, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
the chance of his walk had brought
him to Montmartre, where he had
been born, an unexpected memory
arrested him before the door of the
Brothers’ school in which he had
learned to read. Since it was very
warm, the door was open, and with
a single glance the passing incorrigible
could recognize the peaceful
schoolroom. Nothing was changed:
neither the bright light shining in
through the large windows, nor the
crucifix over the desk, nor the rows
of seats furnished with leaden ink-stands,
nor the table of weights and
measures, nor the map on which
pins stuck in still pointed out the
operations of some ancient war.
Heedlessly and without reflecting,
Jean François read on the blackboard
these words of the Gospel,
which a well-trained hand had traced
as an example of penmanship:</p>


<p class="small1">Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner
that repenteth, more than over ninety and
nine just persons which need no repentance.</p>


<p>14. It was doubtless the hour for
recreation, for the Brother professor
had left his chair, and, sitting on the
edge of a table, he seemed to be
telling a story to all the <em>gamins</em> who
surrounded him, attentive and raising
their eyes. What an innocent
and gay countenance was that of the
beardless young man, in long black
robe, with white necktie, with coarse,
ugly shoes, and with badly cut brown
hair pushed up at the back. All
those pallid faces of children of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
populace which were looking at him
seemed less childlike than his, above
all when, charmed with a candid,
priestly pleasantry he had made, he
broke out with a good and frank peal
of laughter, which showed his teeth
sound and regular&mdash;laughter so contagious
that all the scholars broke
out noisily in their turn. And it was
simple and sweet, this group in the
joyous sunlight that made their clear
eyes and their blonde hair shine.</p>

<p>15. Jean François looked at the
scene some time in silence, and, for
the first time, in that savage nature
all instinct and appetite, there awoke
a mysterious and tender emotion.
His heart, that rude, hardened heart,
which neither the cudgel of the galley-master
nor the weight of the
watchman’s heavy whip falling on his
shoulders was able to stir, beat almost
to bursting. Before this spectacle, in
which he saw again his childhood,
his eyes closed sadly, and, restraining
a violent gesture, a prey to the torture
of regret, he walked away with
great strides.</p>

<p>16. The words written on the
blackboard came back to him.</p>

<p>17. “If it were not too late, after
all!” he murmured. “If I could
once more, like the others, eat my
toasted bread honestly, sleep out my
sleep without nightmare? The police
spy would be very clever to recognize
me now. My beard, that I shaved off
down there, has grown out now thick
and strong. One can borrow somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
in this big ant-heap, and work
is not lacking. Whoever does not go
to pieces soon in the hell of the galleys
comes out agile and robust; and
I have learned how to climb the rope-ladders
with loads on my back.
Building is going on all around here,
and the masons need helpers. Three
francs a day,&mdash;I have never earned
so much. That they should forget
me, that is all I ask.”</p>

<p>18. He followed his courageous
resolution, he was faithful to it, and
three months afterward he was another
man. The master for whom
he labored cited him as his best workman.
After a long day passed on the
scaffolding, in the full sun, in the
dust, constantly bending and straightening
his back to take the stones
from the hands of the man below him
and to pass them to the man above
him, he went to get his soup, at the
cheap eating house, tired out, his legs
numb, his hands burning, and his eyelashes
stuck together by the plaster,
but content with himself, and carrying
his well-earned money in the knot
of his handkerchief. He went out
without fear, for his white mask
made him unrecognizable, and, then,
he had observed that the suspicious
glance of the policeman seldom falls
on the real worker. He was silent
and sober. He slept the sound sleep
of honest fatigue. He was free.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>19. At last&mdash;supreme recompense!&mdash;he
had a friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span></p>

<p>20. It was a mason’s helper like
himself, named Savinien, a little peasant
from Limoges, red-cheeked, who
had come to Paris with his stick over
his shoulder and his bundle on the
end of it, who fled from the liquor-dealers
and went to mass on Sundays.
Jean François loved him for his
piety, for his candor, for his honesty,
for all that he himself had lost, and
so long ago. It was a passion profound,
reserved, disclosing itself in
the care and forethought of a father.
Savinien, himself easily moved and
self-loving, let things take their
course, satisfied only in that he had
found a comrade who shared his horror
of the wine-shop. The two
friends lived together in a furnished
room, fairly clean, but their resources
were very limited; they had to take
into their room a third companion, an
old man from Auvergne, sombre and
rapacious, who found a way of
economizing out of his meagre wages
enough to buy some land in his own
province.</p>

<p>21. Jean François and Savinien
scarcely left each other. On days of
rest they took long walks in the environs
of Paris and dined in the open
air in one of those little country inns
where there are plenty of mushrooms
in the sauces and innocent enigmas
on the bottoms of the plates. There
Jean François made his friend tell
him all those things of which those
born in the cities are ignorant. He
learned the names of the trees, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
flowers, the plants; the seasons for
the different harvests; he listened
avidly to the thousand details of a
farmer’s labors: the autumn’s sowing,
the winter’s work, the splendid <em>fêtes</em>
of harvest-home and vintage, and the
flails beating the ground, and the
noise of the mills by the borders of
the streams, and the tired horses led
to the trough, and the morning hunting
in the mists, and, above all, the
long evenings around the fire of vine-branches,
shortened by tales of wonder.
He discovered in himself a
spring of imagination hitherto unsuspected,
finding a singular delight
in the mere recital of these things,
so gentle, calm, and monotonous.</p>

<p>22. One anxiety troubled him, however,
that Savinien should not come
to know his past. Sometimes there
escaped him a shady word of thieves’
slang, an ignoble gesture, vestiges of
his horrible former existence; and
then he felt the pain of a man whose
old wounds reopen, more especially as
he thought he saw then in Savinien
the awakening of an unhealthy
curiosity. When the young man, already
tempted by the pleasures which
Paris offers even to the poorest,
questioned him about the mysteries of
the great city, Jean François feigned
ignorance and turned the conversation;
but he had now conceived a
vague inquietude for the future of
his friend.</p>

<p>23. This was not without foundation,
and Savinien could not long remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
the naïve rustic he had been on
his arrival in Paris. If the gross and
noisy pleasures of the wine-shop always
were repugnant to him, he was
profoundly troubled by other desires
full of danger for the inexperience
of his twenty years. When the
spring came, he began to seek
solitude, and at first he wandered before
the gayly lighted entrances to
the dancing-halls, through which he
saw the girls going in couples, without
bonnets&mdash;and with their arms
around each other’s waists, whispering
low. Then, one evening, when
the lilacs shed their perfume, and the
appeal of the quadrilles was more entrancing,
he crossed the threshold,
and after that Jean François saw him
change little by little in manners and
in visage. Savinien became more
frivolous, more extravagant; often he
borrowed from his friend his miserable
savings, which he forgot to repay.
Jean François, feeling himself
abandoned, was both indulgent and
jealous; he suffered and kept silent.
He did not think he had the right to
reproach; but his penetrating friendship
had cruel and insurmountable
presentiments.</p>

<p>24. One evening when he was
climbing the stairs of his lodging, absorbed
in his preoccupations, he
heard in the room he was about to
enter a dialogue of irritated voices,
and he recognized one as that of the
old man from Auvergne, who lodged
with him and Savinien. An old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span>
habit of suspicion made him pause
on the landing, and he listened to
learn the cause of the trouble.</p>

<p>25. “Yes,” said the man from Auvergne
angrily, “I am sure that some
one has broken open my trunk and
stolen the three louis which I had hidden
in a little box; and the man who
has done this thing can only be one of
the two companions who sleep here,
unless it is Maria, the servant. This
concerns you as much as me, since
you are the master of the house, and
I will drag you before the judge if
you do not let me at once open up
the valises of the two masons. My
poor hoard! It was in its place only
yesterday; and I will tell you what it
was, so that, if we find it, no one can
accuse me of lying. Oh, I know
them, my three beautiful gold pieces,
and I can see them as plainly as I see
you. One was a little more worn
than the others, of a slightly greenish
gold, and that had the portrait of the
great Emperor; another had that of
a fat old fellow with a queue and
epaulets; and the third had a Philippe
with side-whiskers. I had marked
it with my teeth. No one can trick
me, not me. Do you know that I
needed only two others like those to
pay for my vineyard? Come on, let
us look through the things of these
comrades, or I will call the police.
Make haste!”</p>

<p>26. “All right,” said the voice of
the householder; “we’ll search with
Maria. So much the worse if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
find nothing, and if the masons get
angry. It is you who have forced me
to it.”</p>

<p>27. Jean François felt his heart fill
with fear. He recalled the poverty
and the petty borrowings of Savinien,
the sombre manner he had borne the
last few days. Yet he could not believe
in any theft. He heard the
panting of the man from Auvergne
in the ardor of his search, and he
clenched his fists against his breast as
if to repress the beatings of his heart.</p>

<p>28. “There they are!” suddenly
screamed the victorious miser.
“There they are, my louis, my dear
treasure! And in the Sunday waistcoat
of the little hypocrite from
Limoges. Look, landlord! they are
just as I told you. There’s the Napoleon,
and the man with the queue,
and the Philippe I had dented with
my teeth. Look at the mark. Ah,
the little rascal with his saintly look!
I should more likely have suspected
the other. Ah, the villain! He will
have to go to the galleys!”</p>

<p>29. At this moment Jean François
heard the well-known step of Savinien,
who was slowly mounting the
stairs.</p>

<p>30. “He is going to his betrayal,”
thought he. “Three flights. I have
time!”</p>

<p>31. And, pushing open the door, he
entered, pale as death, into the room
where he saw the landlord and the
stupefied servant in a corner, and
the man from Auvergne on his knees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
amid the disordered clothes, lovingly
kissing his gold pieces.</p>

<p>32. “Enough of this,” he said in a
thick voice. “It is I who have taken
the money and who have put it in
my comrade’s trunk. But that is too
disgusting. I am a thief and not a
Judas. Go hunt for the police. I’ll
not try to save myself. Only, I must
say a word in private to Savinien,
who is here.”</p>

<p>33. The little man from Limoges
had, in fact, just arrived, and, seeing
his crime discovered, and believing
himself lost, he stood still, his eyes
fixed, his arms drooping.</p>

<p>34. Jean François seized him violently
about the neck as though to
embrace him; he pressed his mouth
to Savinien’s ear and said to him in
a voice low and supplicating:</p>

<p>35. “Be quiet!”</p>

<p>36. Then, turning to the others:</p>

<p>37. “Leave me alone with him. I
shall not go away, I tell you. Shut
us up, if you wish, but leave us
alone.”</p>

<p>38. And, with a gesture of command,
he showed them the door.
They went out.</p>

<p>39. Savinien, broken with anguish,
had seated himself on a bed, and
dropped his eyes without comprehending.</p>

<p>40. “Listen,” said Jean François,
who approached to take his hands.
“I understand you have stolen three
gold pieces to buy some trifle for a
girl. That would have cost six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
months of prison for you. But one
does not get out of that except to go
back again, and you would have become
a pillar of the police tribunals
and the courts of assizes. I know
all about them. I have done seven
years in the Reform School, one year
at Sainte-Pélagie, three years at
Poissy, and five years at Toulon.
Now, have no fear. All is arranged.
I have taken this affair on my shoulders.”</p>

<p>41. “Unhappy fellow!” cried Savinien;
but hope was already coming
back to his cowardly heart.</p>

<p>42. “When the elder brother is
serving under the colors, the younger
does not go,” Jean François went on.
“I’m your substitute, that’s all. You
love me a little, do you not? I am
paid. Do not be a baby. Do not refuse.
They would have caught me
one of these days, for I have broken
my exile. And then, you see, that life
out there will be less hard for me
than for you; I know it, and shall not
complain if I do not render you
this service in vain and if you swear
to me that you will not do it again.
Savinien, I have loved you well, and
your friendship has made me very
happy, for it is thanks to my knowing
you that I have kept honest and
straight, as I might have been, perhaps,
if I had had, like you, a father
to put a tool in my hands, a mother
to teach me my prayers. My only
regret was that I was useless to you
and that I was deceiving you about
my past. To-day I lay aside the
mask in saving you. It is all right.
Come, good-bye! Do not weep; and
embrace me, for already I hear the
big boots on the stairs. They are
returning with the police; and we
must not seem to know each other
so well before these fellows.”</p>

<p>43. He pressed Savinien hurriedly
to his breast, and then he pushed
him away as the door opened wide.</p>

<p>44. It was the landlord and the
man from Auvergne, who were
bringing the police. Jean François
started forward to the landing and
held out his hands for the handcuffs
and said, laughing:</p>

<p>45. “Forward, bad lot!”</p>

<p>46. To-day he is at Cayenne, condemned
for life, as an incorrigible.</p>

<p>He [the author] can sometimes rouse our intense curiosity
and eagerness by the mere depiction of a psychological state, as
Walter Pater has done in the case of Sebastian Storck and other
personages of his <em>Imaginary Portraits</em>. The fact that “nothing
happens” in stories of this kind may be precisely what most
interests us, because we are made to understand what it is that
inhibits action.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bliss Perry</span>, <em>A Study of Prose Fiction</em>.</p>

<h3>PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES</h3>
</div>


<p>A subtle distinction is to be observed between the character-study
and the psychological study, but it will not
be supposed that writers of short-stories plainly label the
distinction, or that the two types are frequently, if ever,
found entirely separate. In the character-study more
attention is paid to the true natures of the actors, and
the demonstration of their natures is shown in the action
of the story; in the psychological study more stress is
laid upon the actual operation of thought, feeling and
purpose&mdash;it is a laboratory study of what goes on in the
human heart, to use a somewhat vague but necessary
term, under stress of crisis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span></p>

<p>The psychological study is the most difficult because
the most penetrating of all short-story forms, and in consequence
the most rare in its perfect presentation. To
show the processes of reasoning, the interplay of motive,
the power of feeling acting upon feeling, and the intricate
combinations of these, calls for the most clear-sighted
understanding of man, and the utmost skill in
literary art, lest the story be lost in a fog of tiresome
analysis and discussion. In “Markheim” and “On the
Stairs,” two master story-tellers are easily at their best,
for they never obtrude their own opinions, but swiftly and
with a firm onward movement the stories disclose the
true inward workings of the unique characters, while
from mood, speech, and action we infallibly infer all the
soul-processes by which their conclusions are reached.</p>

<h3>MARKHEIM</h3>

<p class="big05 center">BY ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Introduction.</span>
Remarkable because it at
once touches upon the external
crisis of the story.</div>

<p class="p1">“Yes,” said the dealer, “our wind-falls
are of various kinds. Some
customers are ignorant, and then I
touch a dividend on my superior
knowledge. Some are dishonest,”
and here he held up the candle, so
that the light fell strongly on his
visitor, “and in that case,” he continued,
“I profit by my virtue.”</p>



<p>2. Markheim had but just entered
from the daylight streets, and his
eyes had not yet grown familiar with
the mingled shine and darkness in the
shop.<span class="sidenote">Note double reason.</span> At these pointed words, and
before the near presence of the flame,
he blinked painfully and looked aside.</p>

<div class="sidenote">See how daringly the author
plays with the reader without
arousing suspicion.
Compare Stevenson’s reasoning
as to the reader’s
suspicions with Dupin’s
reasoning in “The Purloined
Letter,” pp. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>,
<a href="#Page_92">92</a>.</div>

<p>3. The dealer chuckled. “You
come to me on Christmas-day,” he
resumed, “when you know that I am
alone in my house, put up my shutters,
and make a point of refusing
business. Well, you will have to pay
for that; you will have to pay for my
loss of time, when I should be balancing
my books; you will have to pay,
besides, for a kind of manner that I
remark in you to-day very strongly.
I am the essence of discretion, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
ask no awkward questions; but when
a customer can not look me in the
eye, he has to pay for it.” The
dealer once more chuckled; and then,
changing to his usual business voice,
though still with a note of irony,<span class="sidenote">Markheim has been there
before.</span>
“You can give, as usual, a clean account
of how you came into possession
of the object?” he continued.
“Still your uncle’s cabinet? A remarkable
collector, sir!”</p>

<p>4. And the little, pale, round-shouldered
dealer stood almost on tip-toe,
looking over the top of his gold
spectacles, and nodding his head with
every mark of disbelief. Markheim
returned his gaze with one of infinite
pity, and a touch of horror.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forecast.</div>

<p>5. “This time,” he said, “you are
in error. I have not come to sell, but
to buy. I have no curios to dispose
of; my uncle’s cabinet is bare to the
wainscot; even were it still intact, I
have done well on the Stock Exchange,
and should more likely add
to it than otherwise, and my errand
to-day is simplicity itself. I seek a
Christmas-present for a lady,” he
continued, waxing more fluent as he
struck <span class="sidenote">Insincerity evident.</span>into the speech he had prepared;
“and certainly I owe you
every excuse for thus disturbing you
upon so small a matter. But the
thing was neglected yesterday; I must
produce my little compliment at dinner;
and, as you very well know,
a rich marriage is not a thing to be
neglected.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span></p>

<p>6. There followed a pause, during
which the dealer seemed to weigh
this statement incredulously. The
ticking of many clocks among the
curious lumber of the shop, and the
faint rushing of the cabs in a near
thoroughfare, filled up the interval of
silence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compare this setting, as it
is gradually unfolded,
with that of Gautier’s
“The Mummy’s Foot.”</div>

<p>7. “Well, sir,” said the dealer, “be
it so. You are an old customer after
all; and if, as you say, you have the
chance of a good marriage, far be
it from me to be an obstacle. Here
is a nice thing for a lady now,” he
went on, “this hand-glass&mdash;fifteenth
century, warranted; comes from a
good collection, too; but I reserve
the name, in the interests of my customer,
who was just like yourself,
my dear sir, the nephew and sole heir
of a remarkable collector.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analyse its nature.</div>

<p>8. The dealer, while he thus ran on
in his dry and biting voice, had
stooped to take the object from its
place; and, as he had done so, a
shock had passed through Markheim,
a start both of hand and foot, a sudden
leap of many tumultuous passions
to the face. It passed as
swiftly as it came, and left no trace
beyond a certain trembling of the
hand that now received the glass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contributory incident.</div>

<p>9. “A glass,” he said, hoarsely, and
then paused, and repeated it more
clearly. “A glass? For Christmas?
Surely not?”</p>

<p>10. “And why not?” cried the
dealer. “Why not a glass?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forecast.</div>
<p>11. Markheim was looking upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span>
him with an indefinable expression.
“You ask me why not?” he said.
“Why, look here&mdash;look in it&mdash;look
at yourself! Do you like to see it?
No! nor I&mdash;nor any man.”</p>

<p>12. The little man had jumped back
when Markheim had so suddenly
confronted him with the mirror; but
now, perceiving there was nothing
worse on hand, he chuckled. “Your
future lady, sir, must be pretty hard
favoured,” said he.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the working of Markheim’s
morbid conscience,
not yet understood by
himself.</div>

<p>13. “I ask you,” said Markheim,
“for a Christmas-present, and you
give me this&mdash;this damned reminder
of years, and sins and follies&mdash;this
hand-conscience! Did you mean it?
Had you a thought in your mind?
Tell me. It will be better for you
if you do. Come, tell me about yourself.
I hazard a guess now, that
you are in secret a very charitable
man?”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Moral Crisis.</span></div>

<p>14. The dealer looked closely at
his companion. It was very odd,
Markheim did not appear to be laughing;
there was something in his face
like an eager sparkle of hope, but
nothing of mirth.</p>

<p>15. “What are you driving at?”
the dealer asked.</p>

<p>16. “Not charitable?” returned the
other, gloomily. “Not charitable;
not pious; not scrupulous; unloving,
unbeloved; a hand to get money, a
safe to keep it. Is that all? Dear
God, man, is that all?”</p>

<p>17. “I will tell you what it is,” began
the dealer, with some sharpness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
and then broke off again into a
chuckle. “But I see this is a love
match of yours, and you have been
drinking the lady’s health.”</p>

<p>18. “Ah!” cried Markheim, with a
strange curiosity. “Ah, have you
been in love? Tell me about that.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note change of attitude.</div>

<p>19. “I,” cried the dealer. “I in
love! I never had the time, nor
have I the time to-day for all this
nonsense. Will you take the glass?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Analyse the forces back of
Markheim’s parleying.</div>

<p>20. “Where is the hurry?” returned
Markheim. “It is very pleasant
to stand here talking; and life is
so short and insecure that I would not
hurry away from any pleasure&mdash;no,
not even from so mild a one as this.
We should rather cling, cling to
what little we can get, like a man
at a cliff’s edge. Every second is
a cliff, if you think upon it&mdash;a cliff
a mile high&mdash;high enough, if we
fall, to dash us out of every feature
of humanity. Hence it is best to talk
pleasantly. Let us talk of each
other; why should we wear this
mask? Let us be confidential. Who
knows, we might become friends?”</p>

<p>21. “I have just one word to say to
you,” said the dealer. “Either make
your purchase, or walk out of my
shop.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note how quickly Markheim
follows the unconscious
lead.</div>

<p>22. “True, true,” said Markheim.
“Enough fooling. To business.
Show me something else.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First External Crisis.</span></div>

<p>23. The dealer stooped once more,
this time to replace the glass upon
the shelf, his thin blonde hair
falling over his eyes as he did so.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
Markheim moved a little nearer, with
one hand in the pocket of his great-coat;
he drew himself up and filled
his lungs; at the same time many <span class="sidenote">
Note all these.</span>
different emotions were depicted together
on his face&mdash;terror, horror
and resolve, fascination and a physical
repulsion; and through a haggard
lift of his upper lip, his teeth looked
out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He was prepared for the
crime.</div>

<p>24. “This, perhaps, may suit,” observed
the dealer; and then, as he
began to re-arise, Markheim bounded
from behind upon his victim. The
long, skewerlike dagger flashed and
fell. The dealer struggled like a hen,
striking his temple on the shelf, and
then tumbled on the floor in a heap.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">First Minor Climax.</span></div>

<p>25. Time had some score of small
voices in that shop, some stately and
slow as was becoming to their great
age; others garrulous and hurried.
All these told out the seconds in an
intricate chorus of tickings. Then
the passage of a lad’s feet, heavily
running on the pavement, broke in
upon these smaller voices and startled
Markheim into the consciousness
of his surroundings. He looked
about him awfully. <span class="sidenote">Beginning of the internal
action. Note how all external
things now begin to
play upon the internal
man.</span> The candle stood
on the counter, its flame solemnly
wagging in a draught; and by that
inconsiderable movement, the whole
room was filled with noiseless bustle
and kept heaving like a sea: the <span class="sidenote">Throughout, note Stevenson’s
rich imagery, and
also his unusual vocabulary.</span>
tall shadows nodding, the gross blots
of darkness swelling and dwindling
as with respiration, the faces of the
portraits and the china gods changing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
and wavering like images in water.
The inner door stood ajar, and
peered into that leaguer <span class="sidenote">An unusual word.</span> of shadows
with a long slit of daylight like a
pointing finger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Picture.</div>


<p>26. From these fear-stricken rovings,
Markheim’s eyes returned to
the body of his victim, where it lay
both humped and sprawling, incredibly
small and strangely meaner than
in life. In these poor, miserly
clothes, in that ungainly attitude, the
dealer lay like so much sawdust.<span class="sidenote">Evidence of premeditation.</span>
Markheim had feared to see it, and,
lo! it was nothing. And yet, as he
gazed, this bundle of old clothes and
pool of blood began to find eloquent
voices.<span class="sidenote">Note the interplay of the
outward picture and Markheim’s
mind. Keep before
you always the double
movement of this study as
both progress side by side,
finally resulting in the
predominance of the spiritual.</span> There it must lie; there was
none to work the cunning hinges
or direct the miracle of locomotion&mdash;there
it must lie till it was found.
Found! ay, and then? Then would
this dead flesh lift up a cry that
would ring over England, and fill
the world with the echoes of pursuit.
Ay, dead, or not, this was still
the enemy. “Time was that when
the brains were out,” he thought;
and the first word struck into his
mind. Time, now that the deed was
accomplished&mdash;time, which had
closed for the victim, had become
instant and momentous for the slayer.</p>

<p>27. The thought was yet in his
mind, when, first one and then another,
with every variety of pace
and voice&mdash;one deep as the bell
from a cathedral turret, another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
ringing on its treble notes the
prelude of a waltz&mdash;the clocks began
to strike the hour of three in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>28. The sudden outbreak of so
many tongues in that dumb chamber
staggered him. He began to bestir
himself, going to and fro with the
candle, beleaguered by moving
shadows, and startled to the soul
by chance reflections. In many rich
mirrors, some of home designs, some
from Venice or Amsterdam, he saw <span class="sidenote">The old motive reasserts itself.</span>
his face repeated and repeated, as
it were an army of spies; his own
eyes met and detected him; and the
sound of his own steps, lightly as
they fell, vexed the surrounding
quiet. <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Plot Incident.</span></span>And still as he continued to
fill his pockets, his mind accused
him, with a sickening iteration, of
the thousand faults of his design.<span class="sidenote">As fear subsides craft returns.</span>
He should have chosen a more quiet
hour; he should have prepared an
alibi; he should not have used a
knife; he should have been more
cautious, and only bound and gagged
the dealer, and not killed him; he
should have been more bold, and
killed the servant also; he should
have done all things otherwise;
poignant regrets, weary, incessant
toiling of the mind to change what
was unchangeable, to plan what was
now useless, to be the architect of <span class="sidenote">A significant expression.</span>
the irrevocable past. Meanwhile,
and behind all this activity, brute
terrors, like scurrying of rats in a
deserted attic, filled the more remote<span class="sidenote">Contrast physical and moral
fear. Consider how the
two are related.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
chambers of his brain with
riot; the hand of the constable would
fall heavy on his shoulder, and his
nerves would jerk like a hooked
fish; or he beheld, in galloping defile,
the dock, the prison, the gallows,
and the black coffin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the primary use of the
word “rumor.”</div>





<p>29. Terror of the people in the
street sat down before his mind like
a besieging army. It was impossible,
he thought, but that some rumor of
the struggle must have reached their
ears and set on edge their curiosity;
and now, in all the neighboring
houses, he divined them sitting motionless
and with uplifted ear&mdash;solitary
people, condemned to spend <span class="sidenote">Contrast.</span>
Christmas dwelling alone on memories
of the past, and now startlingly
recalled from that tender exercise;
happy family parties, struck into
silence round the table, the mother
still with raised finger: every degree
and age and humor, but all, by their
own hearths, prying and hearkening
and weaving the rope that was to
hang him. Sometimes it seemed to
him he could not move too softly;
the clink of the tall Bohemian goblets
rang out loudly like a bell; and
alarmed by the bigness of the ticking,
he was tempted to stop the
clocks. <span class="sidenote">Study of fear.<br />
Impressionism.</span>And then, again, with a
swift transition of his terrors, the
very silence of the place appeared a
source of peril, and a thing to strike
and freeze the passerby; and he
would step more boldly, and bustle
aloud among the contents of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
shop, and imitate, with elaborate
bravado, the movements of a busy
man at ease in his own house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An important observation.</div>

<p>30. But he was now so pulled
about by different alarms that, while
one portion of his mind was still
alert and cunning, another trembled
on the brink of lunacy. One hallucination
in particular took a strong
hold on his credulity. The neighbor
hearkening with white face beside
his window, the passerby arrested
by a horrible surmise on the pavement&mdash;these
could at worst suspect,
they could not know; through the
brick walls and shuttered windows
only sounds could penetrate.<span class="sidenote">Note how his reasoning
becomes hyper-acute</span> But
here, within the house, was he alone?
He knew he was; he had watched
the servant set forth sweethearting,
in her poor best, “out for the day”
written in every ribbon and smile.
Yes, he was alone, of course; and
yet, in the bulk of empty house
above him, he could surely hear a
stir of delicate footing&mdash;he was
surely conscious, inexplicably conscious
of some presence. <span class="sidenote">Forecast.</span>Ay, surely;
to every room and corner of the
house his imagination followed it;
and now it was a faceless thing, and
yet had eyes to see with; and again
it was a shadow of himself; and yet
again behold the image of the dead
dealer, reinspired with cunning and
hatred.</p>


<p>31. At times, with a strong effort,
he would glance at the open door
which still seemed to repel his eyes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
The house was tall, the skylight
small and dirty, the day <span class="sidenote">Note force of “blind.”</span>blind with
fog; and the light that filtered down
to the ground story was exceedingly
faint, and showed dimly on the
threshold of the shop. And yet, in
that strip of doubtful brightness, did
there not hang wavering a shadow?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pseudo crisis.</div>

<p>32. Suddenly, from the street outside,
a very jovial gentleman began
to beat with a staff on the shop-door,
accompanying his blows with
shouts and railleries in which the
dealer was continually called upon
by name. <span class="sidenote">Contributory incident.</span> Markheim, smitten into
ice, glanced at the dead man. But
no! he lay quite still; he was fled
away far beyond earshot of these
blows and shoutings; he was sunk
beneath seas of silence; and his
name, which would once have caught
his notice above the howling of a
storm, had become an empty sound.
And presently the jovial gentleman
desisted from his knocking and departed.</p>

<p>33. Here was a broad hint to hurry
what remained to be done, to get
forth from this accusing neighborhood,
to plunge into a bath of London
multitudes, and to reach, on <span class="sidenote">Note “apparent.”</span>
the other side of day, that haven of
safety and apparent innocence&mdash;his
bed. One visitor had come: at any
moment another might follow and
be more obstinate. <span class="sidenote">Key.</span>To have done
the deed, and yet not to reap the
profit, would be too abhorrent a
failure. The money, that was now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
Markheim’s concern; and as a means
to that, the keys.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note subsidence of acute
fears and rise of his true
mood.</div>

<p>34. He glanced over his shoulder
at the open door, where the shadow
was still lingering and shivering;
and with no conscious repugnance
of the mind, yet with a tremor of the
belly, he drew near the body of his
victim. The human character had
quite departed. Like a suit half-stuffed
with bran, the limbs lay scattered,
the trunk doubled, on the
floor; and yet the thing repelled him.
Although so dingy and inconsiderable
to the eye, he feared it might
have more significance to the touch.
He took the body by the shoulders,
and turned it on its back. It was
strangely light and supple, and the
limbs, as if they had been broken,
fell into the oddest postures. <span class="sidenote">Carefully consider the question
of Markheim’s sanity,
judging only from the
story as thus far told.</span>The
face was robbed of all expression;
but it was as pale as wax, and shockingly
smeared with blood about one
temple. That was, for Markheim,
the one displeasing circumstance. It
carried him back, upon the instant, to
a certain fair day in a fisher’s village:
a gray day, a piping wind, a
crowd upon the street, the blare of
brasses, the booming of drums, the
nasal voice of a ballad singer; and
a boy going to and fro, buried over
head in the crowd and divided between
interest and fear, until, coming
out upon the chief place of concourse,
he beheld a booth and a
great screen with pictures, dismally
designed, garishly colored: Brownrigg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
with her apprentice; the Mannings
with their murdered guest;
Weare in the death-grip of Thurtell;
and a score besides of famous crimes.
The thing was as clear as an illusion;
he was once again that little
boy; he was looking once again, and
with the same sense of physical revolt,
at these vile pictures; he was
still stunned by the thumping of the
drums.<span class="sidenote">Reaction.</span> A bar of that day’s music
returned upon his memory; and at
that, for the first time, a qualm came
over him, a breath of nausea, a sudden
weakness of the joints, which
he must instantly resist and conquer.</p>

<p>35. He judged it more prudent to
confront than to flee from these
considerations; looking the more
hardily in the dead face, bending his
mind to realize the nature and greatness
of his crime. So little a while
ago that face had moved with every
change of sentiment, that pale mouth
had spoken, that body had been all
on fire with governable energies; and
now, and by his act, that piece of
life had been arrested, as the horologist,
with interjected finger,<span class="sidenote">Key. What caused this benumbed
conscience?</span> arrests
the beating of the clock. So
he reasoned in vain; he could rise
to no more remorseful consciousness;
the same heart which had
shuddered before the painted effigies
of crime, looked on its reality unmoved.
At best, he felt a gleam of
pity for one who had been endowed
in vain with all those faculties that
can make the world a garden of enchantment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
one who had never lived
and who was now dead. But of
penitence, no, not a tremor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Plot Incident.</span></div>

<p>36. With that, shaking himself
clear of these considerations, he
found the keys and advanced toward
the open door of the shop. Outside,
it had begun to rain smartly;
and the sound of the shower upon
the roof had banished silence. Like
some dripping cavern, the chambers
of the house were haunted by an incessant
echoing, which filled the ear
and mingled with the ticking of the
clocks. <span class="sidenote">Forecast of moral crisis.</span>And, as Markheim approached
the door, he seemed to hear, in
answer to his own cautious tread,
the steps of another foot withdrawing
up the stair. The shadow still
palpitated loosely on the threshold.
He threw a ton’s weight of resolve
upon his muscles, and drew back the
door.</p>


<p>37. The faint, foggy daylight glimmered
dimly on the bare floor and
stairs; on the bright suit of armor
posted, halbert in hand, upon the
landing; and on the dark wood-carvings,
and framed pictures that
hung against the yellow panels of
the wainscot. So loud was the beating <span class="sidenote">Note harmony of setting
with tone of approaching
crisis.</span>
of the rain through all the house
that, in Markheim’s ears, it began to
be distinguished into many different
sounds. Footsteps and sighs, the
tread of regiments marching in the
distance, the chink of money in the<span class="sidenote">Compare Stevenson’s combination
of fact and fantasy
with Hawthorne’s in
“The White Old Maid.”</span>
counting, and the creaking of doors
held stealthily ajar, appeared to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
mingle with the patter of the drops
upon the cupola and the gushing of
the water in the pipes. The sense
that he was not alone grew upon
him to the verge of madness.<span class="sidenote">Rise toward crisis.</span> On
every side he was haunted and begirt
by presences. He heard them
moving in the upper chambers; from
the shop, he heard the dead man
getting to his legs; and as he began
with a great effort to mount the
stairs, feet fled quietly before him
and followed stealthily behind.<span class="sidenote">Body and spirit.</span> If
he were but deaf, he thought, how
tranquilly he would possess his soul.
And then again, and hearkening with
every fresh attention, he blessed
himself for that unresisting sense
which held the outposts and stood
a trusty sentinel upon his life. His
head turned continually on his neck;
his eyes, which seemed starting from
their orbits, scouted on every side,<span class="sidenote">A notable passage.</span>
and on every side were half-rewarded
as with the tail of something
nameless, vanishing. The four-and-twenty
steps to the first floor were
four-and-twenty agonies.</p>

<p>38. On that first story, the doors
stood ajar, three of them like three
ambushes, shaking his nerves like
the throats of cannon. He could
never again, he felt, be sufficiently
immured and fortified from men’s
observing eyes; he longed to be
home, girt in by walls, buried among <span class="sidenote">Note the exception.</span>
bed-clothes, and invisible to all but
God. And at that thought he wondered
a little, recollecting tales of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
other murderers and the fear they
were said to entertain of heavenly
avengers. It was not so, at least,
with him. He feared the laws of
nature, lest, in their callous and immutable
procedure, they should preserve
some damning evidence of his
crime. He feared tenfold more, with
a slavish, superstitious terror, some
scission in the continuity of man’s
experience, some willful illegality of
nature. He played a game of skill,
depending on the rules, calculating
consequence from cause; and what
if nature, as the defeated tyrant
overthrew the chess-board, should
break the mold of their succession?
The like had befallen Napoleon (so
writers said) when the winter changed <span class="sidenote">Note how suspense in the
reader is maintained by
disclosing Markheim’s suspense.</span>
the time of its appearance. The
like might befall Markheim: the
solid walls might become transparent
and reveal his doings like those of
bees in a glass hive; the stout planks
might yield under his foot like quicksands
and detain him in their clutch;
ay, and there were soberer accidents
that might destroy him; if, for instance,
the house should fall and
imprison him beside the body of his
victim; or the house next door
should fly on fire, and the firemen
invade him from all sides. These
things he feared; and, in a sense,
these things might be called the
hands of God reached forth against <span class="sidenote">Key.</span>
sin. But about God himself he was
at ease; his act was doubtless exceptional,
but so were his excuses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
<span class="sidenote">Is this normal?</span>
which God knew; it was there, and
not among men, that he felt sure of
justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note action of auto-suggestion.</div>

<p>39. When he had got safe into the
drawing-room, and shut the door
behind him, he was aware of a respite
from alarms. The room was
quite dismantled, uncarpeted besides,
and strewn with packing cases and
incongruous furniture; several great
pier-glasses, in which he beheld
himself at various angles, like an
actor on the stage; many pictures,
framed and unframed, standing with
their faces to the wall; a fine Sheraton
sideboard, a cabinet of marquetry,
and a great old bed, with tapestry
hangings. The windows opened to
the floor; but by great good fortune
the lower part of the shutters had
been closed, and this concealed him
from the neighbors. Here, then,
Markheim drew in a packing case before
the cabinet, and began to search
among the keys. It was a long business,
for there were many; and it
was irksome, besides; for, after all,
there might be nothing in the cabinet,
and time was on the wing. But the
closeness of the occupation sobered
him. With the tail of his eye he
saw the door&mdash;even glanced at it
from time to time directly, like a
besieged commander pleased to verify
the good estate of his defenses. <span class="sidenote">Remarkable relief in suspense
period.</span> But
in truth he was at peace. The rain
falling in the street sounded natural
and pleasant. Presently, on the
other side, the notes of a piano were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
wakened to the music of a hymn,
and voices of many children took up
the air and words. How stately,
how comfortable was the melody!
How fresh the youthful voices!
Markheim gave ear to it smilingly,
as he sorted out the keys; and his
mind was thronged with answerable
ideas and images; church-going
children and the pealing of the high
organ; children afield, bathers by
the brookside, ramblers on the
brambly common, kite-flyers in the
windy and cloud-navigated sky; and
then, at another cadence of the hymn,
back again to church, and the somnolence
of summer Sundays, and the
high genteel voice of the parson
(which he smiled a little to recall)
and the painted Jacobean tombs, and
the dim lettering of the Ten Commandments
in the chancel.</p>

<p>40. And as he sat thus, at once
busy and absent, he was startled to
his feet. A flash of ice, a flash of
fire, a bursting gush of blood, went <span class="sidenote">Powerful contrast.</span>
over him, and then he stood transfixed
and thrilling. A step mounted
the stair slowly and steadily, and <span class="sidenote">Approach of moral crisis.</span>
presently a hand was laid upon the
knob, and the lock clicked, and the
door opened.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Markheim perceives only a
physical danger. Note
how long he remains dead
to any moral judgment of
himself.</div>

<p>41. Fear held Markheim in a vice.
What to expect he knew not, whether
the dead man walking, or the
official ministers of human justice,
or some chance witness blindly
stumbling in to consign him to the
gallows. But when a face was thrust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
into the aperture, glanced round the
room, looked at him, nodded and
smiled as if in friendly recognition, <span class="sidenote">Here is a real though unrecognized
moral crisis.
Fear eventually leads to
his moral triumph.</span>
and then withdrew again, and the
door closed behind it, his fear broke
loose from his control in a hoarse
cry. At the sound of this the visitant
returned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the symbolism of the
closed door.</div>

<p>42. “Did you call me?” he asked,
pleasantly, and with that he entered
the room and closed the door behind
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Key.</span></div>


<p>43. Markheim stood and gazed at
him with all his eyes. Perhaps there
was a film upon his sight, but the
outlines of the newcomer seemed to
change and waver like those of the
idols in the wavering candle-light of
the shop; and at times he thought
he knew him; and at times he
thought he bore a likeness to himself;<span class="sidenote">This states the problem.</span>
and always, like a lump of living
terror, there lay in his bosom the
conviction that this thing was not
of the earth and not of God.</p>

<p>44. And yet the creature had a
strange air of the common-place, as
he stood looking on Markheim with
a smile; and when he added: “You
are looking for the money, I believe?”
it was in the tones of everyday
politeness.</p>

<p>45. Markheim made no answer.</p>

<p>46. “I should warn you,” resumed
the other, “that the maid has left
her sweetheart earlier than usual and
will soon be here. If Mr. Markheim
be found in this house, I need not
describe to him the consequences.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span></p>

<p>47. “You know me?” cried the
murderer.</p>

<p>48. The visitor smiled. “You have
long been a favorite of mine,” he
said; “and I have long observed and
often sought to help you.”</p>

<p>49. “What are you?” cried Markheim:
“the devil?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">This is an important passage.</div>

<p>50. “What I may be,” returned
the other, “cannot affect the service
I propose to render you.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Forecast of Markheim’s
struggle with his better
self.</div>

<p>51. “It can,” cried Markheim; “it
does! Be helped by you? No,
never; not by you! You do not
know me yet, thank God, you do
not know me!”</p>

<p>52. “I know you,” replied the
visitant, with a sort of kind severity
or rather firmness. “I know you to
the soul.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Does Markheim really know
himself?</div>

<p>53. “Know me!” cried Markheim.
“Who can do so? My life is but a
travesty and slander on myself. I
have lived to belie my nature. All
men do; all men are better than this
disguise that grows about and stifles
them. You see each dragged away
by life, like one whom bravos have
seized and muffled in a cloak. If
they had their own control&mdash;if you
could see their faces, they would be
altogether different, they would shine
out for heroes and saints! I am
worse than most; myself is more
overlaid; my excuse is known to me
and God. But, had I the time, I
could disclose myself.”</p>

<p>54. “To me?” inquired the visitant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the author’s name for
Markheim.</div>

<p>55. “To you before all,” returned
the murderer. “I supposed you
were intelligent. I thought&mdash;since
you exist&mdash;you would prove a reader
of the heart. And yet you would
propose to judge me by my acts!<span class="sidenote">Seek a cause for such reasoning.</span>
Think of it; my acts! I was born
and I have lived in a land of giants;
giants have dragged me by the
wrists since I was born out of my
mother&mdash;the giants of circumstance.
And you would judge me by my
acts! But can you not look within?
Can you not understand that evil is
hateful to me? Can you not see
within me the clear writing of conscience,
never blurred by any willful
sophistry, although too often disregarded?
Can you not read me for
a thing that surely must be common
as humanity&mdash;the unwilling
sinner?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Note the distinction between
the final importance of
cause and effect.</div>

<p>56. “All this is very feelingly expressed,”
was the reply. “But it regards
me not. These points of consistency
are beyond my province, and
I care not in the least by what compulsion
you may have been dragged
away, so as you are but carried in
the right direction. But time flies;<span class="sidenote">Contrast.</span>
the servant delays, looking in the
faces of the crowd and at the pictures
on the hoardings, but still she keeps
moving nearer; and remember, it is
as if the gallows itself was striding
toward you through the Christmas
streets! <span class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Minor Moral Crisis.</span></span>Shall I help you; I, who
know all? Shall I tell you where to
find the money?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A test of Markheim’s consistency.</div>

<p>57. “For what price?” asked
Markheim.</p>

<p>58. “I offer you the service for a
Christmas gift,” returned the other.</p>

<p>59. Markheim could not refrain
from smiling with a kind of bitter
triumph. “No,” said he, “I will
take nothing at your hands; if I
were dying of thirst, and it was your
hand that put the pitcher to my lips,
I should find the courage to refuse.
It may be credulous, but I will do
nothing to commit myself to evil.”</p>

<p>60. “I have no objection to a
death-bed repentance,” observed the
visitant.</p>

<p>61. “Because you disbelieve their
efficacy!” Markheim cried.</p>

<p>62. “I do not say so,” returned
the other; “but I look on these
things from a different side, and
when the life is done my interest
falls. <span class="sidenote">Key.</span>The man has lived to serve
me, to spread black looks under
color of religion, or to sow tares in
the wheat-field, as you do, in a
course of weak compliance with desire.<span class="sidenote">Is this irony?</span>
Now that he draws so near to
his deliverance, he can add but one
act of service&mdash;to repent, to die
smiling, and thus to build up in confidence
and hope the more timorous
of my surviving followers. I am not
so hard a master. Try me. Accept
my help. Please yourself in life as
you have done hitherto; please yourself
more amply, spread your elbows
at the board; and when the night
begins to fall and the curtains to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
drawn, I tell you, for your greater
comfort, that you will find it even
easy to compound your quarrel with
your conscience, and to make a
truckling peace with God. I came
but now from such a death bed, and
the room was full of sincere mourners,
listening to the man’s last words:
and when I looked into that face,
which had been set as a flint against
mercy, I found it smiling with hope.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Markheim has judged the
example.</div>

<p>63. “And do you, then, suppose me
such a creature?” asked Markheim.
“Do you think I have no more generous
aspirations than to sin, and
sin, and sin, and, at last, sneak into
heaven? My heart rises at the
thought. Is this, then, your experience
of mankind? or is it because
you find me with red hands that
you presume such baseness? and is
this crime of murder indeed so
impious as to dry up the very springs
of good?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Is this true reasoning?</div>

<p>64. “Murder is to me no special
category,” replied the other. “All
sins are murder, even as all life is
war. I behold your race, like starving
mariners on a raft, plucking
crusts out of the hands of famine
and feeding on each other’s lives.<span class="sidenote">Note the detached attitude.</span>
I follow sins beyond the moment of
their acting; I find in all that the
last consequence is death; and to my
eyes, the pretty maid who thwarts
her mother with such taking graces
on a question of a ball, drips no less
visibly with human gore than such
a murderer as yourself.<span class="sidenote">Note paradox.</span> Do I say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
that I follow sins? I follow virtues
also; they differ not by the thickness
of a nail, they are both scythes for
the reaping angel of Death. Evil,
for which I live, consists not in
action but in character. The bad
man is dear to me; not the bad act,
whose fruits, if we could follow them
far enough down the hurtling cataract
of the ages, might yet be found
more blessed than those of the rarest
virtues. And it is not because you
have killed a dealer, but because you
are Markheim, that I offered to forward
your escape.”</p>

<p>65. “I will lay my heart open to
you,” answered Markheim. “This
crime on which you find me is my
last. On my way to it I have learned
many lessons; itself is a lesson,
a momentous lesson. <span class="sidenote">An unusual expression.</span>Hitherto I
have been driven with revolt to what
I would not; I was a bond-slave to
poverty, driven and scourged. There
are robust virtues that can stand in
these temptations; mine was not so:<span class="sidenote">Note use of “of.”</span>
I had a thirst of pleasure. But to-day,
and out of this deed, I pluck
both warning and riches&mdash;both the
power and a fresh resolve to be myself.
I become in all things a free
actor in the world; <span class="sidenote">Could that have been?</span>I begin to see
myself all changed, these hands the
agents of good, this heart at peace.
Something comes over me out of the
past; something of what I have
dreamed on Sabbath evenings to the
sound of the church organ, of what
I forecast when I shed tears over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
noble books, or talked, an innocent
child, with my mother. There lies
my life; I have wandered a few
years, but now I see once more my
city of destination.”</p>

<p>66. “You are to use this money
on the Stock Exchange, I think?”
remarked the visitor; “and there, if
I mistake not, you have already lost
some thousands?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Self-deception uncovered.</div>

<p>67. “Ah,” said Markheim, “but
this time I have a sure thing.”</p>

<p>68. “This time, again, you will
lose,” replied the visitor, quietly.</p>

<p>69. “Ah, but I keep back the
half!” cried Markheim.</p>

<p>70. “That also you will lose,” said
the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral crisis begins to appear
to Markheim.</div>

<p>71. The sweat started upon Markheim’s
brow. “Well, then, what
matter?” he exclaimed. “Say it be
lost, say I am plunged again in
poverty, shall one part of me, and
that the worse, continue until the
end to override the better? Evil and
good run strong in me, haling me
both ways. I do not love the one
thing, <span class="sidenote">Self-deception still struggling.</span>I love all. I can conceive
great deeds, renunciations, martyrdoms;
and though I be fallen to such
a crime as murder, pity is no stranger
to my thoughts. I pity the poor;
who knows their trials better than
myself? I pity and help them; I
prize love, I love honest laughter;
there is no good thing nor true thing
on earth but I love it from my heart.
And are my vices only to direct my
life, and my virtues to lie without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span>
effect, like some passive lumber of
the mind? Not so; good, also, is
a spring of acts.”</p>

<p>72. But the visitant raised his finger.
“For six-and-thirty years that
you have been in this world,” said
he, “through many changes of fortune
and varieties of humor, I have
watched you steadily fall. <span class="sidenote">Here the story is plainly
didactic.</span>Fifteen
years ago you would have started at
a theft. Three years back you would
have blenched at the name of murder.
Is there any crime, is there any
cruelty or meanness, from which you
still recoil?&mdash;five years from now I
shall detect you in the fact! Downward,
downward, lies your way; nor
can anything but death avail to stop
you.”</p>

<p>73. “It is true,” Markheim said,
huskily, “I have in some degree complied
with evil. But it is so with
all: the very saints, in the mere exercise
of living, grow less dainty,
and take on the tone of their surroundings.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Key.</div>

<p>74. “I will propound to you one
simple question,” said the other;
“and as you answer, I shall read to
you your moral horoscope. You
have grown in many things more lax;
possibly you do right to be so; and
at any account, it is the same with
all men. But granting that, are
you in any one particular, however
trifling, more difficult to please with
your own conduct, or do you go in
all things with a looser rein?”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Minor Moral Climax.</span><br />
Markheim at last sees himself.</div>

<p>75. “In any one?” repeated Markheim,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
with an anguish of consideration.
“No,” he added, with despair,
“in none! I have gone down in all.”</p>

<p>76. “Then,” said the visitor, “content
yourself with what you are, for
you will never change; and the words
of your part on this stage are irrevocably
written down.”</p>

<p>77. Markheim stood for a long
while silent, and indeed it was the
visitor who first broke the silence.
“That being so,” he said, “shall I
show you the money?”</p>

<p>78. “And grace?” cried Markheim.</p>

<p>79. “Have you not tried it?” returned
the other. “Two or three
years ago, did I not see you on the
platform of revival meetings, and
was not your voice the loudest in
the hymn?”</p>

<p>80. “It is true,” said Markheim;
“and I see clearly what remains for
me by way of duty. I thank you for
these lessons from my soul: my eyes
are opened, and I behold myself at
last for what I am.”</p>

<p>81. At this moment, the sharp note
of the door-bell rang through the
house; and the visitant, as though
this were some concerted signal for
which he had been waiting, changed
at once in his demeanor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p><span class="smcap">Full Moral Crisis.</span></p>
<p>Physical Resultant Crisis.</p></div>



<p>82. “The maid!” he cried. “She
has returned, as I forewarned you,
and there is now before you one
more difficult passage. Her master,
you must say, is ill; you must let
her in, with an assured but rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
serious countenance&mdash;no smiles, no
overacting, and I promise you success!<span class="sidenote">Final test.</span>
Once the girl within, and the
door closed, the same dexterity that
has already rid you of the dealer will
relieve you of this last danger in
your path. Thenceforward you have
the whole evening&mdash;the whole night,
if needful&mdash;to ransack the treasures
of the house and to make good your
safety. This is help that comes to
you with the mask of danger. Up!”
he cried: “up, friend; your life
hangs trembling in the scales; up,
and act!”</p>

<p>83. Markheim steadily regarded his
counsellor. “If I be condemned to
evil acts,” he said, “there is still
one door of freedom open&mdash;I can
cease from action. If my life be an
ill thing, I can lay it down. Though
I be, as you say truly, at the beck
of every small temptation, I can yet,
by one decisive gesture, place myself
beyond the reach of all. My love
of good is damned to barrenness; it
may, and let it, be! But I have still
my hatred of evil; and from that, to
your galling disappointment, you
shall see that I can draw both energy
and courage.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who was the visitant?</div>

<p>84. The features of the visitor began
to undergo a wonderful and
lovely change; they brightened and
softened with a tender triumph; and,
even as they brightened, faded and
dislimned. But Markheim did not
pause to watch or understand the
transformation. He opened the door
and went downstairs very slowly,
thinking to himself. His past went
soberly before him; he beheld it as
it was, ugly and strenuous like a
dream, random as chance-medley&mdash;a
scene of defeat. Life, as he thus
reviewed it, tempted him no longer;
but on the further side he perceived
a quiet haven for his bark. He
paused in the passage, and looked into
the shop, where the candle still burned
by the dead body. It was strangely
silent. Thoughts of the dealer
swarmed into his mind, as he stood
gazing. And then the bell once more
broke out into impatient clamor.</p>

<p>85. He confronted the maid upon
the threshold with something like a
smile.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Moral Climax. Denouement.</span></div>

<p>86. “You had better go for the
police,” said he: “I have killed your
master.”</p>

<h3>MORRISON AND HIS WRITINGS</h3>

<p>Arthur Morrison was born in Kent, England, in 1863.
After some experience as a clerk in the civil service, as
the secretary of a charity trust in the East End of London,
and as a journalist on the editorial staff of an evening
paper, he settled down definitely to his career as
novelist and writer on oriental art. He is best known as
a journalist, however, and his familiarity with the East
End has largely contributed to his success in depicting
the sordid life of London’s “mean streets,” as the “remorseless
realism” of his pictures testify. Mr. Morrison’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
literary work was in the nature of prose and
verse panegyrizing bicycles and bicycling. His principal
works, apart from several plays and magazine contributions,
are <em>Tales of Mean Streets</em>; the several <em>Martin
Hewitt</em> (detective) books; <em>A Child of the Jago</em>; <em>To
London Town</em>; <em>The Hole in the Wall</em>; <em>The Red Triangle</em>;
<em>The Green Eye of Goona</em> (published in America as <em>The
Green Diamond</em>); and <em>The Painters of Japan</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Morrison’s best fiction is not large in bulk, for his
detective stories are surpassed both in merit and in popular
appeal by more than one writer on similar themes;
but in his <em>Tales of Mean Streets</em>, which contains the appended
study, “On the Stairs,” he has attained a compressed
power equalled only by the French realists and
scarcely surpassed even by them. He has brought the
art of suggestion to a high pass, his swiftness and firmness
of delineation are equally effective, and though his
subjects are sordid and often depressing they live before
us as real folk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The introduction to <em>Tales of Mean Streets</em> appeared in <em>Macmillan’s
Magazine</em> in October, 1891, where it was called simply,
“A Street.” This sketch attracted the attention of Mr. W. E.
Henley, who gave the young writer the benefit of his own
knowledge and criticism; and it is to Henley and to Walter
Besant that Mr. Morrison makes special acknowledgment for
help in the technicalities and mechanism of his tales. Most of
these <em>Tales of Mean Streets</em> appeared in the <em>National Observer</em>
(while Henley was the editor), and a few in the <em>Pall Mall
Budget</em>.&mdash;<em>Book Buyer</em> (London), vol. 12.</p>

<p>If the modern novel about the slums, such as novels of Mr.
Arthur Morrison, or the exceedingly able novels of Mr. Somerset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
Maugham, are intended to be sensational, I can only say that that
is a noble and reasonable object, and that they attain it.... It
may be ... it is necessary to have in our fiction the image of the
horrible and hairy East-ender, merely to keep alive in us a fearful
and childlike wonder at external peculiarities.... To summarize,
our slum fiction is quite defensible as æsthetic fiction; it
is not defensible as spiritual fact.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gilbert K. Chesterton</span>,
<em>Heretics</em>.</p>

<p>Ever seeking the clean-cut, picturesque phrase and the vivid
word, he produced a very striking picture of the East End. But,
nevertheless, it was not quite satisfactory and convincing. Human
nature does not alter so much with conditions as he seems
to think. A little less or a little more morality does not affect
its elements.... Mr. Morrison’s strongest gift in writing is a
cynicism that is almost brutal. With it he elaborates the features
of all his characters till the impression is produced that one
savage, hideous, ugly coster and one gaudy-feathered, bedizened
“Jonah” have acted as models for all his studies of Jagodom.
Moreover, his success has been achieved in pictures of the brutal.&mdash;<em>Academy</em>
(London), vol. 52.</p>

<p>The “mean streets” are streets in London.... [They] have
found in Arthur Morrison an interpreter who lifts them out of
their meanness upon the plane of a just claim to human sympathy.
He lets us see the relief. Bill Napper, the drunken
kerb-whacker, come into property and defending it against the
rascally labor agitator, Scuddy Lond, mixing religious fervor and
till-tapping with entire sincerity, Simmons and Ford, victims of
their joint wife’s “jore” and mania for trouser-making, even
the Anarchists of the Red Cow group, appeal to us with a sense
almost of kinship because we feel that the figures are real.
They are capital character-studies besides. Dickens never made
a finer than the thief Scuddy Lond, or than Billy Chope....
The art of these stories seems flawless. Mr. Morrison’s gift
amounts to genius.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jacob Riis</span>, <em>Romances of “The Other Half,”

<h3>ON THE STAIRS</h3>

<p class="big05 center">BY ARTHUR MORRISON</p>

<p class="p1">The house had been “genteel.”
When trade was prospering in the
East End, and the ship-fitter or
block-maker thought it no shame to
live in the parish where his workshop
lay, such a master had lived
here. Now, it was a tall, solid,
well-bricked, ugly house, grimy and
paintless in the joinery, cracked and
patched in the windows: where the
front door stood open all day long;
and the womankind sat on the steps,
talking of sickness and deaths and
the cost of things; and treacherous
holes lurked in the carpet of road-soil
on the stairs and in the passage.
For when eight families live in a
house, nobody buys a door-mat, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>
the street was one of those streets
that are always muddy. It smelt,
too, of many things, none of them
pleasant (one was fried fish); but
for all that it was not a slum.</p>

<p>2. Three flights up, a gaunt woman
with bare forearms stayed on her
way to listen at a door which, opening,
let out a warm, fetid waft from
a close sick-room. A bent and tottering
old woman stood on the threshold,
holding the door behind her.</p>

<p>3. “An’ is 'e no better now, Mrs.
Curtis?” the gaunt woman asked,
with a nod at the opening.</p>

<p>4. The old woman shook her head,
and pulled the door closer. Her jaw
waggled loosely in her withered
chaps: “Nor won’t be; till 'e’s
gone.” Then after a certain pause,
“'E’s goin’,” she said.</p>

<p>5. “Don’t doctor give no 'ope?”</p>

<p>6. “Lor’ bless ye, I don’t want to
ast no doctors,” Mrs. Curtis replied,
with something not unlike a chuckle.
“I’ve seed too many on ’em. The
boy’s a-goin’, fast; I can see that.
An’ then”&mdash;she gave the handle another
tug, and whispered&mdash;“he’s
been called.” She nodded amain;
“Three seprit knocks at the bed-head
las’ night; an’ I know what <em>that</em>
means!”</p>

<p>7. The gaunt woman raised her
brows, and nodded. “Ah, well,”
she said, “we all on us comes to it
some day, sooner or later. An’ it’s
often a 'appy release.”</p>

<p>8. The two looked into space beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</span>
each other, the elder with a
nod and a croak. Presently the other
pursued, “'E’s been a very good
son, ain’t 'e?”</p>

<p>9. “Ay, ay, well enough son to
me,” responded the old woman, a little
peevishly; “an’ I’ll 'ave ’im put
away decent, though there’s on’y the
Union for me after. I can do that,
thank Gawd!” she added, meditatively,
as chin on fist she stared into
the thickening dark over the stairs.</p>

<p>10. “When I lost my pore 'usband,”
said the gaunt woman with a
certain brightening, “I give ’im a
'ansome funeral. 'E was a Oddfeller,
an’ I got twelve pound. I 'ad
a oak caufin an’ a open 'earse. There
was a kerridge for the fam’ly an’ one
for 'is mates&mdash;two 'orses each, an’
feathers, an’ mutes; an’ it went the
furthest way round to the cimitry.
'Wotever 'appens, Mrs. Manders,’
says the undertaker, ‘you’ll feel as
you’ve treated 'im proper; nobody
can’t reproach you over that.’ An’
they couldn’t. 'E was a good 'usband
to me, an’ I buried ’im respectable.”</p>

<p>11. The gaunt woman exulted.
The old, old story of Manders’s
funeral fell upon the other one’s ears
with a freshened interest, and she
mumbled her gums ruminantly.
“Bob’ll 'ave a 'ansome buryin', too,”
she said. “I can make it up, with
the insurance money, an’ this, an’
that. On’y I dunno about mutes.
It’s a expense.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span></p>

<p>12. In the East End, when a woman
has not enough money to buy a
thing much desired, she does not say
so in plain words; she says the thing
is an “expense,” or a “great expense.”
It means the same thing,
but it sounds better. Mrs. Curtis
had reckoned her resources, and
found that mutes would be an “expense.”
At a cheap funeral mutes
cost half-a-sovereign and their liquor.
Mrs. Manders said as much.</p>

<p>13. “Yus, yus, 'arf-a-sovereign,” the
old woman assented. Within, the
sick feebly beat the floor with a stick.
“I’m a-comin’,” she cried shrilly;
“yus, 'arf-a-sovereign, but it’s a lot,
an’ I don’t see 'ow I’m to do it&mdash;not
at present.” She reached for
the door-handle again, but stopped
and added, by after-thought, “Unless
I don’t 'ave no plooms.”</p>

<p>14. “It 'ud be a pity not to 'ave
plooms. I 'ad&mdash;”</p>

<p>15. There were footsteps on the
stairs: then a stumble and a testy
word. Mrs. Curtis peered over into
the gathering dark. “Is it the
doctor, sir?” she asked. It was the
doctor’s assistant; and Mrs. Manders
tramped up to the next landing
as the door of the sick-room took
him in.</p>

<p>16. For five minutes the stairs
were darker than ever. Then the
assistant, a very young man, came
out again, followed by the old woman
with a candle. Mrs. Manders
listened in the upper dark. “He’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span>
sinking fast,” said the assistant. “He
<em>must</em> have a stimulant. Dr. Mansell
ordered port wine. Where is it?”
Mrs. Curtis mumbled dolorously. “I
tell you he <em>must</em> have it,” he
averred with unprofessional emphasis
(his qualification was only a month
old). “The man can’t take solid
food, and his strength must be kept
up somehow. Another day may
make all the difference. Is it because
you can’t afford it?” “It’s a
expense&mdash;sich a expense, doctor,”
the old woman pleaded. “An’ wot
with 'arf-pints o’ milk an’&mdash;” She
grew inarticulate, and mumbled dismally.</p>

<p>17. “But he must have it, Mrs.
Curtis, if it’s your last shilling: it’s
the only way. If you mean you absolutely
haven’t the money&mdash;” and
he paused a little awkwardly. He
was not a wealthy young man&mdash;wealthy
young men do not devil for
East End doctors&mdash;but he was conscious
of a certain haul of sixpences
at nap the night before; and, being
inexperienced, he did not foresee the
career of persecution whereon he
was entering at his own expense and
of his own motion. He produced
five shillings: “If you absolutely
haven’t the money, why&mdash;take this
and get a bottle&mdash;good: not at a
public-house. But mind, <em>at once</em>.
He should have had it before.”</p>

<p>18. It would have interested him,
as a matter of coincidence, to know
that his principal had been guilty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span>
of the selfsame indiscretion&mdash;even
the amount was identical&mdash;on that
landing the day before. But, as Mrs.
Curtis said nothing of this, he
floundered down the stair and out
into the wetter mud, pondering
whether or not the beloved son of
a Congregational minister might take
full credit for a deed of charity on
the proceeds of sixpenny nap. But
Mrs. Curtis puffed her wrinkles, and
shook her head sagaciously as she
carried in her candle. From the
room came a clink as of money falling
into a teapot. And Mrs. Manders
went about her business.</p>

<p>19. The door was shut, and the
stair a pit of blackness. Twice a
lodger passed down, and up and
down, and still it did not open. Men
and women walked on the lower
flights, and out at the door, and in
again. From the street a shout or
a snatch of laughter floated up the
pit. On the pavement footsteps rang
crisper and fewer, and from the bottom
passage there were sounds of
stagger and sprawl. A demented old
clock buzzed divers hours at random,
and was rebuked every twenty minutes
by the regular tread of a policeman
on his beat. Finally, somebody
shut the street-door with a great
bang, and the street was muffled. A
key turned inside the door on the
landing, but that was all. A feeble
light shone for hours along the
crack below, and then went out. The
crazy old clock went buzzing on, but
nothing left that room all night.
Nothing that opened the door....</p>

<p>20. When next the key turned, it
was to Mrs. Manders’s knock, in the
full morning; and soon the two
women came out on the landing together,
Mrs. Curtis with a shapeless
clump of bonnet. “Ah, 'e’s a lovely
corpse,” said Mrs. Manders. “Like
wax. So was my 'usband.”</p>

<p>21. “I must be stirrin’,” croaked
the old woman, “an’ go about the
insurance an’ the measurin’ an’ that.
There’s lots to do.”</p>

<p>22. “Ah, there is. 'Oo are you
goin’ to 'ave,&mdash;Wilkins? I 'ad Wilkins.
Better than Kedge, <em>I</em> think:
Kedge’s mutes dresses rusty, an’
their trousis is frayed. If you was
thinkin’ of 'avin’ mutes&mdash;”</p>

<p>23. “Yus, yus,”&mdash;with a palsied
nodding,&mdash;“I’m a-goin’ to 'ave
mutes: I can do it respectable, thank
Gawd!”</p>

<p>24. “And the plooms?”</p>

<p>25. “Ay, yus, and the plooms too.
They ain’t sich a great expense, after
all.”</p>

<h3>SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS FOR STUDY</h3>

<p>1. What are the points of similarity between the Character-Study
and the Psychological Study?</p>

<p>3. Does Markheim’s change of heart seem to you to be genuine?
Give your reasons.</p>

<p>4. Analyze his motives fully.</p>

<p>5. Is the supernatural element convincing?</p>


<p>6. Could conscience produce the same effect as the Visitant?</p>

<p>7. What impression did Stevenson seek to convey by “Markheim”?</p>

<p>8. Fully analyze the thoughts, feelings, and motives of the
mother.</p>

<p>9. Can you detect Morrison’s motive in writing “On the
Stairs”?</p>

<p>10. Fully analyze one other psychological study, from any
source.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
